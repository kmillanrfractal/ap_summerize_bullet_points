"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The smell of hairspray clouds Alexa Flores López as she gets the finishing touches of an intricate updo on her thick black hair. When Alexa found out she was going to have a quinceañera — the traditional celebration for a 15th birthday in Mexico — she could barely contain herself.\n\She got super excited, like her heart would come out!\"" said her mother, Carmen López Díaz. \""She was just counting down the days.\""\nAt the Federico Gomez Children\\'s Hospital in Mexico City, volunteers clad in white and blue nurse uniforms scurry to attend to birthday girls and boys. They curl hair, do makeup, and adjust bow ties.\nIt\'s all for the hospital\'s annual \""Mis XV\"" or \""My Fifteenth\"" event. Whether the young patients are in treatment for a serious disease or have overcome cancer, the hospital celebrates the coming-of-age of these teenagers. After going through expensive treatments, some families can\'t afford to pay for a party — with the hospital providing them an alternative.\n\""We\'ve really just bought shoes because the hospital handles everything,\"" said Díaz. \nThe hospital started throwing the event in 2017 after volunteer nurses caught wind that a beloved patient would turn 15 soon. They took it as an opportunity to organize a celebration for her and eventually turned it into an annual hospital event that\'s been going strong for seven years.\nIn Mexico, the \""quinceñera\"" or \""fifteenth birthday\"" is a huge rite of passage for adolescents, particularly girls. The occasion marks the transition of a teen into adulthood.\nThough Alexa\'s birthday was last month, the hospital allows patients to participate if their birthdays happen within the year of the celebration. \nShe has been a patient at the hospital the past three years receiving treatment for lupus. Her younger sister was just diagnosed with the same disease last year, making things more difficult for the family. However, the hospital\'s celebration has been something to look forward to. \n\""We never imagined so much — we thought this was going to be a regular hospital event,\"" her mother said. \nFrancesca Solórzano, who has been a volunteer at the hospital for 17 years, assists Alexa on her big day and attends to her every need. Solórzano makes sure the teen has enough water and showers hairspray onto her dress to make sure its fabric remains crisp. \nShe also sports a silver and blue pin that matches Alexa\'s bouquet.\n\""I receive more than I give,\"" Solórzano says about volunteering. \""I give my time here and I get a lot of blessings in return.\""\nSolórzano takes Alexa into a dressing area to change into her dress. When she comes out in a deep navy blue gown sprinkled with sequins, volunteers exclaim, \""How pretty!\"" Another volunteer takes her cellphone out and snaps a picture. \""She looks like a princess!\"" \nOn the other end of the room, Carlos Emilio Escalona García, 15, takes a seat with his mom after getting suited up. \nFor his mother, Marta Magdalena García Chávez, the day is filled with nothing but joy.\n\""It\'s really beautiful to see all of this happening,\"" she said. \""He just had surgery so we wouldn\'t have had the possibility to have a party.\""\nCarlos has been a patient with the hospital for 13 years. He has dealt with heart problems since he was a child, and just underwent his fourth surgery. His mother said he gets tired often, but is still motivated to make the most out of every day.\n\""Like every other teenager, my favorite class is physical education,\"" Carlos says. \""I also really enjoy doing math — I have so much fun doing different operations.\""\nThe preparations for the hospital\'s extravaganza have been a long time in the making. As early as January the hospital is already reaching out to make-up artists and other vendors to see if they want to participate. The entire event comes together free of charge.\nAfter getting fitted into their regal looks, it\'s time for the party to start.\nDownstairs in the banquet hall, family members crowd the dance floor, craning their necks to get a look at the teenagers. As they walk in with their partners, Carlos and Alexa end up lined up side by side.\n\""A round of applause for our fifteen-year-olds!\"" says someone in the crowd.\nAs they kick off the first dance, Alexa takes the hand of her partner and her mom zooms in on her phone to get a video. After the chorus of the song settles, her mother takes a deep breath and puts her phone away — ready to capture the moment.\nShe stares in awe at her daughter as she twirls in her blue tulle skirt.\n"""

"Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, has been announced as the new leader of the militant group Hamas. \nHe rose to the top position after the killing of the previous leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Iran that has been blamed on Israel.\nSome things to know about Sinwar:\nFrom refugee camp to Hamas militant\nSinwar was born in 1962 in a refugee camp in the Gaza town of Khan Younis. He was an early member of Hamas, which was formed in 1987. He eventually led the group\'s security arm, which worked to purge it of spies for Israel.\nIsrael arrested him in the late 1980s and he admitted to killing 12 suspected collaborators, a role that earned him the nickname \The Butcher of Khan Younis.\"" He was sentenced to four life terms for offenses that included the killing of two Israeli soldiers.\nA prison leader\nSinwar organized strikes in prison to improve working conditions. He also studied Hebrew and Israeli society. \nHe survived brain cancer in 2008 after being treated by Israeli doctors.\nSinwar was released from prison in 2011 by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as part of an exchange for an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid. \nRise to Gaza power\nWhen Sinwar returned to Gaza, he quickly rose through Hamas\' leadership ranks with a reputation for ruthlessness. He is widely believed to be behind the 2016 killing of another top Hamas commander, Mahmoud Ishtewi, in an internal power struggle.\nSinwar became head of Hamas in Gaza, effectively putting him in control of the territory, and worked with Haniyeh to align the group with Iran and its proxies around the region while also building the group\'s military capabilities. \nThe October attack on Israel\nSinwar, along with Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas\' armed wing, is believed to have engineered the surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\nThe attack killed about 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and sparked a war that has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there.\nHamas said it launched the attack in retaliation for Israel\'s treatment of Palestinians and to push the Palestinian cause back onto the world agenda.\nIsrael said it killed Deif in an attack last month.\nWhere does this leave Hamas?\nSinwar has been in hiding since the attack and cease-fire negotiators have said it takes days to get messages to him. That makes it hard to believe that he will be able to handle Hamas\' day-to-day operations.\nSinwar, with his close ties to Hamas\' armed wing, is seen as striking an even more hardline tone than Haniyeh did. And he also had a virtual veto over any cease-fire deal Hamas would have reached with Israel since he controls the Israeli hostages central to such an agreement.\nIsrael has vowed to kill Sinwar.\n"""
"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are bouncing back after the market experienced its worst day in two years on Monday, but the average investor may still be understandably spooked. Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday, up 1.6% in midday trading. \n\This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,\"" said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. \""You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\""\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\nWhat to do in general\n\""It\\'s important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There\'s going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\"" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \""Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\""\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\n\""For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\"" Silver said. \""But it\\'s very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent… It\\'s a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)\\'s or IRA\\'s or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\""\nSilver urged investors to remember that \""a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\"" and that \""usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\""\nWhat to do if you\'re a young or new investor\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\""You\'re reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\"" he said. \""So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\""\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down. \nWhat to do if you\'re near retirement\n\""Whenever you invest in stocks it\\'s important to be mindful of your time horizon,\"" said Alev. \""For instance, do you expect you\\'ll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you\\'re likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\""\nSilver agreed.\n\""I don\\'t believe it when people say, ‘Don\\'t look at your 401(k),\\'\"" he said. \""You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\""\nIf it doesn\'t, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\nNationwide\'s Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn\'t more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\""If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\"" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future. \nWhat to do if you have debt\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it\'s important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \""if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\"" Silver said.\n__\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Microplastics have been found in the ocean and the air, in our food and water. They have been found in a wide range of body tissues, including the heart, liver, kidneys and even testicles.\nBut are they actually harming you?\nEvidence suggests they might, but it\'s limited in scope. Some researchers are worried, but acknowledge there are lots of unanswered questions.\nDr. Marya Zlatnik, a San Francisco-based obstetrician who has studied environmental toxins and pregnancy, has seen studies raising concerns about microplastics\' impact on the health of babies and adults. \nBut it\'s a young research field, and it\'s not something she generally discusses with patients.\n\I\'m not entirely sure what to say yet,\"" Zlatnik said.\nHere\'s a look at what\'s known so far:\nWHAT ARE MICROPLASTICS?\nPlastics are man-made materials — many of them derived from oil or other petroleum products. They can break down into smaller particles, through exposure to heat and weather and even animal digestion. \nResearchers have increasingly been interested in microplastics, which can be as wide as a pencil eraser or as small as a fraction of the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics, another area of study, are even smaller.\nThese minuscule plastics have been detected in air, water and soil, in milk, and in bottled and tap drinking water. They also have been found in a variety of foods, including salt, sugar, honey, rice and seafood. \nARE THERE MICROPLASTICS IN YOU?\nMost likely yes.\nThere is scientific debate about how much people inhale and ingest, and it can vary on what they eat and drink and where they live, researchers say. \nSome Australian researchers, on behalf of the World Wildlife Fund, calculated in 2019 that many people each week consume roughly 5 grams of plastic from common food and beverages — the equivalent of a credit card. That estimate is not universally embraced by researchers, but is commonly mentioned in news articles. \nResearchers are still trying to understand exposure levels, but study after study is finding signs of plastics in body tissues.\n\""Microplastics have been measured in pretty much all of the body tissues that have been evaluated,\"" said Tracey Woodruff, a University of California at San Francisco researcher. Scientists have even reported finding them in the penis, in ovaries and in placentas.\nWILL MICROPLASTICS HURT YOU?\nThat\'s still being sorted out. \nA 2022 World Health Organization report concluded there was no clear risk to human health, based on the available evidence. \nThere\\'s also not an obvious signal of widespread public health impact, at least in terms of mortality. Cancer, heart disease and stroke death rates have been falling, not rising. \nBut researchers only started measuring plastics in the human body — and trying to assess the health effects — in recent years. Some of that work is only coming to fruition now.\nIt makes sense that microplastics are harmful because they contain toxic chemicals, said Woodruff, who was part of a team that reviewed nearly 2,000 studies about microplastics at the request of California legislators. It may be, for example, that microplastics play a role in rising occurrences of some cancers in younger people, she said.\nAvailable information indicates plastics can spark inflammation and cause other problematic changes in the body that can, for example, raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \nA small study in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year suggested, but did not prove, that patients with evidence of plastics in their arteries were at greater risk of death from heart attacks and strokes. But an expert not involved in the research suggested the study may have overstated any effects.\n\""Even though there\\'s a lot we still don\\'t know about microplastic particles and the harm they cause to humans, the information that is available today is in my mind very concerning,\"" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, of Boston College.\nWHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT MICROPLASTICS?\nThere are ways to reduce potential microplastics exposure, researchers say.\nTake your shoes off before you go in the house, to avoid tracking in plastics-laden dust (not to mention germs, dirt and other debris) throughout your home.\nEat foods — especially fresh fruits and vegetables — that you prepare in the home.\nDon\\'t microwave a meal in a plastic tray, no matter what TV dinner instructions might say, Woodruff said. \nAnd opt for reusable stainless steel or glass water bottles, rather than disposable plastic ones, she added.\nZlatnik, the obstetrician, noted that families with limited incomes may have bigger things to worry about. \n\""If someone is worried about where their next meal is going to come from, I\'m not going to give them advice to keep their leftovers in glass containers and to not microwave in plastic,\"" she said.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Science and Educational Media Group.

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — What began as peaceful protests by students in Bangladesh against a quota system for government jobs eventually turned into an uprising that forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee the country by helicopter. \nNow, opposition leaders and the country\'s military are talking about appointing an interim government that is expected to organize new elections in what critics of Hasina say is a restoration of democracy.\nThe end to Hasina\'s 15 years in power came after weeks of violent unrest during which nearly 300 people died, according to local media reports. \nThe government repeatedly tried to quell demonstrations they blamed on sabotage and opposition parties with bullets, curfews and internet outages, but these heavy-handed moves backfired, fueling outrage and further protests.\nOn Monday, protesters defied a military curfew to march into the capital\'s center, following a weekend of violence left dozens of people dead. As troops pulled back and internet access was restored, tens of thousands of people began to celebrate in the streets, and thousands stormed the leader\'s official residence.\nHere\\'s what we know:\nWho will lead the next government?\nShortly after Hasina resigned, the country\'s military chief said the army would seek the figurehead president\'s guidance to appoint an interim government. \nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin announced late Monday after meeting with Gen. Waker-uz-Zamam and opposition politicians that Parliament would be dissolved as soon as possible, leading to fresh elections.\nThe next day, a key student leader said that the movement wanted Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus to head the interim government. \nNahid Islam said in a video posted on social media that student protest leaders had already talked with Yunus, who consented to take over considering the present situation of the country. \nYunus faced a number of corruption accusations and was put on trial during Hasina\\'s rule. He received the Nobel in 2006 after he pioneered microlending, and he said the corruption charges against him were motivated by vengeance. \nGen. Waker-uz-Zaman also promised to launch an investigation into the deadly crackdowns that fueled outrage against the government.\n\Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\"" he said. \""I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\""\nHe asked for patience as a new government is formed.\n\""Now, the students\\' duty is to stay calm and help us,\"" he added.\nHow did the protests start?\nThe protests, which have drawn hundreds of thousands, began in July with students demonstrating against a controversial quota system that allocated government jobs.\nIt turned violent on July 15 as student protesters clashed with security officials and pro-government activists, prompting authorities to disperse tear gas, fire rubber bullets and to close schools and impose a curfew with a shoot-on-sight order. The internet and mobile data were also turned off.\nThe government says nearly 150 people died last month, while local media have reported that more than 200 were killed.\nWhy were they protesting?\nAt first, the demonstrations were against a quota system that set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\\'s 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.\nProtesters said the system was discriminatory and benefited supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\\'s Awami League party, which led the independence movement.\nThe furor highlighted the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. There\\'s a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.\nAs the violence crested, the Supreme Court last month ruled that the veterans\\' quota must be cut to 5%, with 93% of jobs to be allocated on merit. The remaining 2% will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people.\nThe government accepted the decision, and restored the internet thinking that the situation would ease. But the protests grew, with new demands for investigations into the deadly crackdowns, and eventually for Hasina and her cabinet to step down.\n___\nPathi reported from New Delhi. \n"""
"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Long before a would-be assassin wounded former President Donald Trump, the fuse of political violence had been burning across America.\nMembers of Congress have been shot. One lawmaker\'s staffers in Virginia were attacked with a baseball bat. In Louisville, a bullet grazed the mayor\\'s sweater after someone stormed into his campaign office. Someone put a tracking device on the Reno mayor\'s car. Officials in South Carolina received death threats over a solar panel plant. And outside Buffalo, a man threw a dummy pipe bomb through the window of a county clerk candidate\'s home — with a message reading: \If you don\\'t drop out of this race, the next pipe bomb will be real.\""\n\""There are people who\\'ve come to me and said, ‘I contemplated running for my town office, and I could never imagine my family going through what you did, so I chose not to,\\'\"" said Melissa Hartman, who was targeted in the pipe bomb episode and ran for county clerk after serving as town supervisor in Eden.\nThe attempt on Trump\'s life was the latest and most stunning example of political violence and harassment playing out regularly across America, shaking the foundations of democracy and causing grave concern the atmosphere will worsen as Election Day nears. Trump and President Joe Biden each called for unity after the shooting, with the president telling the nation, \""We can\'t allow violence to be normalized.\""\nIntense partisanship, punctuated by violence, has long been a part of American politics. In 1798, congressmen from opposing parties brawled in the U.S. House chamber, beating each other with a cane and fireplace tongs. Four presidents have been killed by assassins, with other presidents and candidates wounded or targeted. Yet the attack on Trump evoked memories of more recent incidents. \nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords was wounded in a 2011 shooting outside an Arizona grocery store. Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, now House majority leader, was shot in 2017 while practicing for a charity baseball game. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan was the target of a foiled kidnapping plot uncovered in 2020.\nEven after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol shocked the world, political violence continued. \nA man with a hammer bludgeoned the husband of then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, in their San Francisco home in 2022. Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to the Fairfax, Virginia, district office of Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, looking to kill him with a baseball bat. Connolly wasn\\'t there, so the man attacked two staffers.\nAnd there are dozens of stories from far lesser-known political officials like Hartman. \nShe lost her county clerk race and hasn\'t sought elective office since in her town of 7,700. The man who threw the dummy pipe bomb pleaded guilty. Hartman said he was paid to do it by a neighbor, and she remains skittish two years later. \nIn York County, South Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina, County Council Chairwoman Christi Cox said that after the attempt on Trump, she felt compelled to speak about a letter she recently received. She\'d sent her kids to get the mail and read it while they were nearby — a threat to kill her unless she stopped a solar panel manufacturer from building a $150 million plant receiving council-approved incentives.

"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Janette Navarro\\'s 1996 Volkswagen Beetle roars as it barrels up a steep hill overlooking concrete houses stacked like boxes on the outskirts of Mexico City.\nShe presses her foot on the pedal, passes a lime green Beetle like hers, then one marked with red and yellow, then another painted a bright sea blue.\n\No other car gets up here,\"" she said. \""Just the vocho.\""\nThe Volkswagen Beetle, or \""vocho\"" as it\\'s known in Mexico, may have been born in Germany, but in this hilly neighborhood on the fringes of Mexico City, there\\'s no doubt about it: The \""Bug\"" is king.\nThe Beetle has a long history in the country\\'s sprawling capital. The old-school models like these — once driven as taxis — used to dot city blocks as the quirky look captured the fascination of many around the world. It was long known as \""the people\\'s car.\""\nBut after production of older models halted in Mexico in 2003, and the newer versions in 2019, the Bug population is dwindling in the metro area of 23 million people. But in the northern neighborhood of Cuautepec, classic Beetles still line the streets — so much so that the area has been nicknamed \""Vocholandia.\""\nTaxi drivers like Navarro say they continue to use the vochos because the cars are inexpensive and the engine located in the back of the vehicle gives it more power to climb the neighborhood\'s steep hills.\nNavarro began driving Beetles for work eight years ago as a way to feed her three children and put them through school.\n\""When they ask me what I do for work, I say proudly that I\\'m a vochera (a vocho driver),\"" Navarro said a day before the International Day of the VW Beetle on Saturday. \""This work keeps me afloat … It\\'s my adoration, my love.\""\nWhile some of the older cars wobble along, paint long faded after years of wear and tear, other drivers dress their cars up, keeping them in top shape.\nOne driver has named his bright blue car \""Gualupita\"" after his wife, Guadalupe, and adorns the bottom with aluminum flames blasting out from a VW logo. Another painted their VW pink and white, sticking pink cat eyes on the front headlights.\nMechanics in the area, though, say driving vochos is a dying tradition. David Enojosa, a car mechanic, said his family\\'s small car shop in the city used to sell parts and do maintenance primarily on Beetles. But since Volkswagen halted production five years ago, parts have been harder to come by.\n\""With the current trend, it will disappear in two or three years,\"" Enojosa said, his hands blackened by car grease. \""Before we had too many parts for vochos, now there aren\\'t enough … So they have to look for parts in repair shops or junkyards.\""\nAs he spoke, a customer walked up carrying a worn down bolt, looking for a replacement for his Volkswagen\\'s clutch.\nThe customer, Jesús Becerra, was in luck: Enojosa strolled out of his shop holding a shiny new bolt.\nLess lucky drivers have to do laps around the neighborhood looking for certain parts. Even more cars fall into disrepair and don\\'t pass emissions inspections.\nBut Becerra is among those who believed that the vochos will endure in his neighborhood.\n\""You adapt them, you find a way to make it keep running,\"" he said. \""You say, ‘We\\'re going to do this, fix it and let\\'s go.\\'\""\nOthers like Joaquín Peréz say continuing to drive his 1991 white, Herbie-style Beetle is a way to carry on his family tradition. He grew up around Bugs, he explained as his car rumbled. His father was a taxi driver just like him and he learned how to drive in a VW.\nNow, 18 years into working as a driver himself, his dashboard is lined with trinkets from his family. A plastic duck from his son, a frog stuffed animal from his daughter and a fabric rose from his wife.\n\""This area, always, always since I can remember has been a place of vochos,\"" he said. \""This here is the car of the people.\""\n"""
"TOKYO (AP) — Onstage, Danjuro Ichikawa, one of the biggest stars of Japan\'s Kabuki theater, is a virtuoso in switching roles.\nIn his latest production, he plays 13 parts, including a princess, a sushi chef and a fox. He hobbles offstage as a feeble old man, then dashes back on moments later as a fierce warrior. He gets in a few sword fights, dies tragically more than once, and takes flight on wires.\nOffstage, he\'s wondering if it\'s time for the often rigid role of a Kabuki star to change.\nThe 13th man to bear the name Danjuro Ichikawa — which has been passed down between generations of Kabuki stars for over 300 years — he\'s a household name in Japan, showing up in ads, movies and TV shows.\nKabuki, an all-male theatrical tradition that combines music, dance and acrobatics, remains popular, but Danjuro grants that it can be out of step with modern tastes. Audiences accustomed to TikTok videos and streaming don\'t always have the patience for four-hour performances in archaic formal Japanese. Social distancing restrictions during the pandemic hit theaters hard, and audiences are still coming back.\nDanjuro has made efforts to update Kabuki in \Hoshiawase Jusandan,\"" at the Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo through July 24, trimming longer scenes and modernizing some dialogue. \n\""Traditional culture might be hard to follow and get tiresome, but I hope people will have fun. The action moves quickly because I\\'m one person playing 13 roles,\"" Danjuro told The Associated Press.\nDapper and tanned, Danjuro, 46, can be disarmingly playful for a famous artist. Amid discussions of the future of live performance, he gamely posed for photos, striking the kind of pose you\'d see on the romantic lead of a manga comic book. \nThe all-male theatrical style can be intensely conservative, preserving many of its traditions nearly unchanged from the Edo court.\nToday\\'s Danjuro took on the name in 2022, after going through earlier names he and all the previous Danjuros have gone through: Shinnosuke, and then Ebizo.\nTraining starts at childhood. When he was 20, about to go on stage for the first time as the monk Benkei — a role that his father, grandfather and all the Danjuros before him had made famous — the pressure was so intense he ran away and spent the night sleeping in the park. He did get back in time for the show.\nToday\\'s Danjuro inherited the name from his father, Danjuro XII, who died in 2013 at 66 of leukemia.\nThe death cost him both a beloved parent and a teacher he desperately need. At 35, he was still a novice by Kabuki standards, an artform in which beautiful maidens are often played by octogenarian masters. He had to turn to uncles and veterans from other families to learn the craft, defying criticism from peers and even family who said only a Danjuro can teach another Danjuro. \nBut these days, critics say the 13th Danjuro is living up to his name. \nDespite the art\'s firm commitment to tradition, Danjuro says, Kabuki stories contain universal emotions that young people and foreigners who are new to the genre can connect with.\nIn \""Hoshiawase Jusandan,\"" he plays a fox who disguises himself as a warrior to stalk a court dancer who\'s carrying a drum made from the hide of his parents.\nWhen at the climax, a merciful samurai gives the fox the drum, Danjuro\'s takes flight on wires, bouncing with joy over the crowd toward the third-floor balcony seats, accompanied by drums, flute and song. \nThe showy, somewhat dated effect could look like something out of a circus — but it sells a moving scene that contrasts the human folly of war and revenge with the simple love shown by an animal. \nFor all his worry, Danjuro says he trusts that the power of human performance will survive. \nHe\'s training his son Shinnosuke to take his place, and taking care of his health to be sure future generations of Shinnosukes have a chance to know their ancestor.\nOne day, Shinnosuke will become Ebizo, and later, he\'ll be Danjuro XIV. \n\""One must live,\"" said Danjuro. \""That\\'s my responsibility.\""\n___\nYuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n"""
"NEW YORK (AP) — Victoria Cornejo Barrera thought the legal helpline for workers sounded too good to be true. \nA month earlier, Cornejo Barrera had been forced to take leave from her job as head custodian at a South Carolina high school after she turned in a doctor\'s note asking to be exempt from tasks like climbing ladders and lifting more than 20 pounds because she was pregnant. \nShe spent a month crying and blaming herself for thinking she could keep her job while pregnant. She used up all her accumulated paid time off because she couldn\'t afford to go without a paycheck. Then she got a notice from human resources saying she would have to start paying $600 a month to stay on health insurance while on unpaid leave.\n\I was feeling so guilty. I was feeling like my pregnancy was the problem,\"" Cornejo Barrera said. \nSearching for help online, she came across the website run by the legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, explaining about a federal law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that entitled her to the types of accommodations she had been seeking.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Victoria Cornejo Barrera thought the legal helpline for workers sounded too good to be true and wondered if it was a scam. \nA month earlier, Cornejo Barrera had been forced to take leave from her job as head custodian at a South Carolina high school after she turned in a doctor\'s note asking to be exempt from tasks like climbing ladders and lifting more than 20 pounds because she was pregnant. \nShe spent a month crying and blaming herself for thinking she could keep her job while pregnant. She used up all her accumulated paid time off because she couldn\'t afford to go without a paycheck. Then she got a notice from human resources saying she would have to start paying $600 a month to stay on health insurance while on unpaid leave.\n\I was feeling so guilty. I was feeling like my pregnancy was the problem,\"" Cornejo Barrera said. \nSearching for help online, she came across the website run by the legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, explaining about a federal law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that entitled her to the types of accommodations she had been seeking. It had gone into effect in June 2023, a month before she was pushed out of her job.\nWas the law really on her side? Cornejo Barrera called the helpline.\nA new law\'s complicated first year \nNearly 500 workers in similar circumstances have contacted A Better Balance\'s legal helpline in the year since the implementation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which strengthens the rights of workers to seek accommodations for pregnancy-related needs.

But many women still confronted employers who didn\'t know about the law, misunderstood its scope or simply refused to comply, according to the report.\nCharlotte Burrows, chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law and conducts outreach to employers and labor groups, said raising awareness is a major challenge. \n\""I don\\'t think we\\'re where we need to be yet,\"" Burrows said. \""We\\'re going to be trying very hard to make sure that we close that information gap for everybody.\""\nA bitter legal battle over whether the law covers abortion, however, is complicating its enforcement. \nThe dispute centers on EEOC regulations that took effect Tuesday detailing how employers should comply with the law, and which included abortion among the pregnancy-related conditions that entitle workers to time off and other accommodations.\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily prohibited the EEOC from enforcing the abortion provision of its rules against employers located in Louisiana and Mississippi, or against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and three other religious groups that filed a consolidated lawsuit against the EEOC, arguing that the abortion provision is an illegal interpretation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\nAnother judge in Arkansas last week dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general from 17 states, but Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is leading the case, said he is considering legal options to continue pursuing the challenge. \nThat lawsuit had asked the judge to suspend the EEOC rules in their entirety, a prospect that the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Women\'s Law Center, along with more than 20 labor and women\\'s advocacy groups, warned in amicus briefs could thwart the successful implementation of law.\nThe EEOC\'s rules, for example, make clear that employers cannot delay requests by asking pregnant workers for onerous paperwork to back claims of common pregnancy-related limitations such as morning sickness or back pain.

She struggled to shower and leave her home. \""Mentally, I just was not in a good place where I felt like I was good enough to be my daughter\\'s mom,\"" she said. \""I couldn\\'t get her to stop crying.\""\nAfter her disability leave ended in July 2023, her therapist recommended she work from home to ease the transition and told her she was entitled to such an accommodation under the new law. But her company resisted her request for more than a month. During one excruciating meeting, she realized that the company had shared her personal information, including her struggles with hygiene, with her male manager, only to insist that nothing she described impeded her from doing her job at the office. \n\""I\\'m literally in tears thinking about it,\"" she said. \""I\\'m so embarrassed.\""\nRobinson reached out to A Better Balance for help and the company relented. She is preparing to return to the office this week after several months of working from home.\nOther workers are still fighting to be protected under the law. \nEarlier this month, A Better Balance filed charges with the EEOC on behalf of two women alleging violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. One was an employee of a Chick-fil-A franchise in Indiana who said she was docked points under a punitive attendance system after seeking time to recover from a near-miscarriage that sent her to the emergency room. Another involves an Amtrak engineer who said the railway company marked the first few days she took to give birth as unexcused absences, putting her at risk of being fired, then refused to accommodate her need to pump milk after she returned to work. \nAmtrak declined to comment on pending litigation. Chick-fil-A referred questions to representatives of the franchise, whose owner, Jeff Hoffman, declined to comment. \nThe EEOC says it has received 1,869 charges so far citing violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and has resolved more than 450, though it has not provided details on the cases.\nThe abortion issue complicates the law\nThe law\'s passage in 2022 came after years of campaigning by advocacy groups and women in low-wage jobs who shared stories of being denied even basic accommodations.

"AYETORO, Nigeria (AP) — The coastal Nigerian community of Ayetoro was founded decades ago and nicknamed \Happy City,\"" meant to be a Christian utopia that would be sinless and classless. But now its remaining residents can do little against the rising sea.\nBuildings have sunk into the Atlantic Ocean, an increasingly common image along the vulnerable West African coast. Old timber pokes from the waves like rotten teeth. Shattered foundations line the shore. Waves break against abandoned electrical poles.\nFor years, low-lying nations have warned the world about the existential threat of rising seas. Nigeria, Africa\'s most populous country, struggles to respond. Some plans to address shoreline protection, even for Ayetoro, have come to nothing in a nation where corruption and mismanagement is widespread.\nPrayers against the rising sea are \""on the lips of everybody\"" in the church every Sunday, according to youth leader Thompson Akingboye. But they know the solution will require far more.\nEven the church has been relocated away from the sea, twice. \""The present location is now also threatened, with the sea just 30 meters (98 feet) away,\"" Akingboye said. \nThousands of people have left. Of those who remain, Stephen Tunlese can only gaze from a distance at the remnants of his clothing shop.\nTunlese said he lost an investment of eight million naira, or the equivalent of $5,500, to the sea. Now he adapts to a watery future. He repairs canoes.\n\""I will stay in Ayetoro because this is my father\\'s land, this is heritage land,\"" he said.\nThe Mahin mud coast where the community is slipping away has lost more than 10 square kilometers, or nearly 60% of its land, to the ocean in the past three decades.\nResearchers studying satellite imagery of Nigeria\\'s coast say a number of things are contributing to Ayetoro\'s disappearance.\nUnderwater oil drilling is one reason, according to marine geologist Olusegun Dada, a professor at the Federal University of Technology in Akure who has studied years of satellite imagery. As resources are extracted, the ground can sink.\nBut he and colleagues note other reasons, including the deforestation of mangroves that help anchor the earth and the erosion caused by ocean waves.\n\""When we started coming to this community, then we used to have fresh water,\"" Dada said. Today, the freshwater ecosystem is transforming into a salty, marine one.\nThe transformation is enormously costly in Nigeria. The World Bank in a 2020 report estimated the cost of coastal degradation in three other coastal Nigerian states — nearby Lagos, Delta and Cross River — at $9.7 billion, or more than 2% of the country\'s GDP. It looked at erosion, flooding, mangrove loss and pollution, and noted the high rate of urbanization.\nAnd yet dramatic images of coastal communities slipping away only capture Nigeria\'s attention from time to time, as when the annual flooding occurs — another effect of climate change.\nBut Ayetoro residents can\'t turn away.\n\""Ayetoro was like a paradise, a city where everyone lived joyfully, happily,\"" said Arowolo Mofeoluwa, a retired civil servant.\nShe estimated that two-thirds of the community has been slowly swept under the waves, along with some residents\' multiple attempts to rebuild.\n\""This is the third house we are living in, and there are some living in the fourth house now, and we do not have enough space for ourselves again. Four or five people living in a small room, you can just imagine how painful it is,\"" Mofeoluwa said.\n\""If you look where the sea is now, that is the end of the former Ayetoro.\""\nFor the community\'s traditional leader and head of the local church, Oluwambe Ojagbohunmi, the pain is not only in the loss of land but also \""what we are losing in our socio-cultural and religious identity.\""\nSome residents say even burial grounds have been washed away.\nEarly this year, the Ondo state government announced a commitment to finding \""lasting solutions\"" to the threat to Ayetoro. But residents said that\'s been vowed in the past.\nIt might be too late for efforts to be effective, Dada said. For years, he has hoped for an environmental survey to be carried out to better understand what\'s causing the community\'s disappearance. But that\'s been in vain.\nThe Niger Delta Development Commission, a government body meant in part to address environmental and other issues caused by oil exploration, didn\'t respond to questions from The Associated Press about efforts to protect the community\'s shoreline.\nThe commission\'s website lists a shoreline protection project in Ayetoro. A photo shows a sign marking the feat with the motto, \""Determined to make a difference!\""\nThe project was awarded two decades ago. Project status: \""Ongoing.\""\nResidents say nothing ever started.\n\""Help will come one day, we believe,\"" youth leader Akingboye said.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

"Idaho librarian June Meissner was closing up for the day at the downtown Boise Public Library when a man approached her asking for help. \nAs an information services librarian, answering patrons\' questions is part of Meissner\\'s day-to-day work, and serving the community is one of her favorite parts of the job. \nBut when the man got close enough, \he took a swing at me and tried to punch me in the head,\"" said Meissner, a transgender woman. \""I blocked it and he started yelling slurs and suggesting that he was going to come back and kill me.\""\nWorldwide Pride Month events are well underway to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights. But it is coming at a time when people who identify as LGBTQ+ say they are facing increasing difficulties at work, ranging from being repeatedly misgendered to physically assaulted. \nGender nonconforming library workers in particular, like Meissner, are also grappling with growing calls for book bans across the U.S., with books about gender identity, sexual orientation and race topping the list of most criticized titles and making the attacks all the more personal.\n\""When we see attacks on those books, we have to understand that those are attacks on those kinds of people as well,\"" said Emily Drabinski, who is the president of the American Library Association and is gay. \""To have my identity weaponized against libraries and library workers, the people and institutions I care about the most, has made it a difficult and painful year.\""\nThe ALA said it documented the highest-ever number of titles targeted for censorship in 2023 in more than 20 years of tracking -- 4,240. That total surpassed 2022\\'s previous record by 65%, with Maia Kobabe\\'s coming-of-age story \""Gender Queer\"" topping the list for most criticized library book for the third straight year.\nLawmakers are increasingly considering lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment for distributing books some regard as inappropriate, including in Meissner\\'s home state of Idaho. Lawmakers there passed legislation that empowers local prosecutors to bring charges against public and school libraries if they don\\'t keep \""harmful\"" materials away from children. The new law, signed by Idaho Gov. Brad Little in April, will go into effect on July 1.\n\""I do think that a lot of that political speech around it does make things more dangerous and worse for me,\"" Meissner said. \""It is so much politicking and getting the general public riled up.\""\nMeissner\\'s own attacker was arrested and convicted, and she says that while the vast majority of her interactions at work are positive, she still struggles to let her guard down and is constantly assessing whether a situation could turn unsafe.\n\""As somebody who is working face to face with the public and trying to help people as much as possible, that really does get in the way,\"" she told The Associated Press, describing how she waits to make eye contact with a patron \""and then, based on what I see when they look at me, that\\'ll tell me whether or not I should just be on edge, be wary.\"" \nFlorida-based conservative nonprofit Moms for Liberty, which describes itself as a parental rights organization and refers to its members as \""joyful warriors,\"" has been at the forefront of a nationwide push to remove books that deal with race and gender identity.\nBut co-founder Tiffany Justice says the organization — which she says has more than 300 chapters in 48 states and more than 130,000 active members — is not anti-LGBTQ+, although Justice herself told the AP she thinks that the Q in the acronym, which stands for queer or questioning, \""needs to go into the trash bin.\"" And according to the ALA\'s Office for Intellectual Freedom, about 38% of book challenges that \""directly originated\"" from Moms for Liberty activity have LGBTQ+ themes.\nJustice said Moms for Liberty challenges books like Gender Queer — a graphic novel about a young person\\'s struggle with gender identity that contains illustrations of sexual contact, masturbation and a sex toy — because they view the material as sexually explicit, not because they cover LGBTQ+ topics. \n\""The least interesting thing about a child should be their sexual orientation,\"" Justice said. \""Why are we flooding them with sexual content?\""\nDespite the thousands of petitions to censor books about gender and sex, legal standards for deeming materials obscene or harmful to minors — and therefore not protected speech under the First Amendment — are very specific and high, and courts have historically sided with libraries, according to Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on rights to free speech in the digital age.\n\""The mere fact that something is describing sex, describing nudity, even depicting those things, is not enough to make it qualify as obscenity,\"" she said.\nRegardless, the book banning movement has in many cases successfully restricted access to materials in which LGBTQ+ youth can see themselves depicted. \nAs of June 1, Louisiana libraries must allow parents or guardians to decide which books their child can check out. M\\'issa Fleming, a public librarian in New Orleans who uses they/them pronouns, says the new law could make it even more dangerous for queer and trans kids, who are already at higher risk of being victims of violence, substance use, and suicide than their straight, cisgender peers. And losing access to LGBTQ+ themed books may cause kids to turn to less reliable sources like Reddit.\n\""Public libraries could be offering as many ways as possible to make it less dangerous to learn about yourself, and the law just added another challenge,\"" Fleming said. \nChaz Carey, a children\'s librarian in Worthington, Ohio, knows firsthand how powerful books can be. Alison Bechdel\'s 2006 graphic memoir \""Fun Home,\"" in which the author comes to grips with her sexual orientation, changed Carey\'s life as a teenager. \n\""I felt seen. It was like my whole body just let out a breath,\"" said Carey, who is queer and uses they/them pronouns. \""It is just so important that these books remain on shelves. They save lives.\""\nCarey says being a children\'s librarian is a dream job, but the rise in book challenges and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric takes a mental toll. They are frequently misgendered at work, including by some patrons who go out of their way to do so while airing their political beliefs.\n\""The political environment is just an extra kind of weight as we navigate our lives and our places in our community,\"" said Carey, who chairs ALA\'s Rainbow Roundtable, which aims to serve the information needs of LGBTQ+ people. \nFor Carey, what helps is \""taking some time to feel sad, but then choosing queer joy and pride.\""\n___\nThe Associated Press\\' women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

"BERLIN (AP) — When Michael Bommer found out that he was terminally ill with colon cancer, he spent a lot of time with his wife, Anett, talking about what would happen after his death.\nShe told him one of the things she\'d miss most is being able to ask him questions whenever she wants because he is so well read and always shares his wisdom, Bommer recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press at his home in a leafy Berlin suburb. \nThat conversation sparked an idea for Bommer: Recreate his voice using artificial intelligence to survive him after he passed away.\nThe 61-year-old startup entrepreneur teamed up with his friend in the U.S., Robert LoCascio, CEO of the AI-powered legacy platform Eternos. Within two months, they built \a comprehensive, interactive AI version\"" of Bommer — the company\'s first client. \nEternos, which got its name from the Italian and Latin word for \""eternal,\"" says its technology will allow Bommer\'s family \""to engage with his life experiences and insights.\"" It is among several companies that have emerged in the last few years in what\\'s become a growing space for grief-related AI technology. \nOne of the most well-known start-ups in this area, California-based StoryFile, allows people to interact with pre-recorded videos and uses its algorithms to detect the most relevant answers to questions posed by users. Another company, called HereAfter AI, offers similar interactions through a \""Life Story Avatar\"" that users can create by answering prompts or sharing their own personal stories.\nThere\\'s also \""Project December,\"" a chatbot that directs users to fill out a questionnaire answering key facts about a person and their traits — and then pay $10 to simulate a text-based conversation with the character. Yet another company, Seance AI, offers fictionalized seances for free. Extra features, such as AI-generated voice recreations of their loved ones, are available for a $10 fee.\nWhile some have embraced this technology as a way to cope with grief, others feel uneasy about companies using artificial intelligence to try to maintain interactions with those who have passed away. Still others worry it could make the mourning process more difficult because there isn\'t any closure.\nKatarzyna Nowaczyk-Basinska, a research fellow at the University of Cambridge\\'s Centre for the Future of Intelligence who co-authored a study on the topic, said there is very little known about the potential short-term and long-term consequences of using digital simulations for the dead on a large scale. So for now, it remains \""a vast techno-cultural experiment.\"" \n\""What truly sets this era apart — and is even unprecedented in the long history of humanity\\'s quest for immortality — is that, for the first time, the processes of caring for the dead and immortalization practices are fully integrated into the capitalist market,\"" Nowaczyk-Basinska said. \nPRESERVING A CONNECTION\nRobert Scott, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, uses AI companion apps Paradot and Chai AI to simulate conversations with characters he created to imitate three of his daughters. He declined to speak about what led to the death of his oldest daughter in detail, but he lost another daughter through a miscarriage and a third who died shortly after her birth.\nScott, 48, knows the characters he\\'s interacting with are not his daughters, but he says it helps with the grief to some degree. He logs into the apps three or four times a week, sometimes asking the AI character questions like \""how was school?\"" or inquiring if it wants to \""go get ice cream.\"" \nSome events, like prom night, can be particularly heart-wrenching, bringing with it memories of what his eldest daughter never experienced. So, he creates a scenario in the Paradot app where the AI character goes to prom and talks to him about the fictional event. Then there are even more difficult days, like his daughter\'s recent birthday, when he opened the app and poured out his grief about how much he misses her. He felt like the AI understood. \n\""It definitely helps with the what ifs,\"" Scott said. \""Very rarely has it made the ‘what if\\'s\\' worse.\"" \nMatthias Meitzler, a sociologist from Tuebingen University, said that while some may be taken aback or even scared by the technology — \""as if the voice from the afterlife is sounding again\"" — others will perceive it as an addition to traditional ways of remembering dead loved ones, such as visiting the grave, holding inner monologues with the deceased, or looking at pictures and old letters.\nBut Tomasz Hollanek, who worked alongside Nowaczyk-Basinska at Cambridge on their study of \""deadbots\"" and \""griefbots,\"" says the technology raises important questions about the rights, dignities and consenting power of people who are no longer alive. It also poses ethical concerns about whether a program that caters to the bereaved should be advertising other products on its platform. \n\""These are very complicated questions,\"" Hollanek said. \""And we don\\'t have good answers yet.\"" \nPREPARING FOR DEATH\nThe AI version of Bommer that was created by Eternos uses an in-house model as well as external large language models developed by major tech companies like Meta, OpenAI and the French firm Mistral AI, said the company\'s CEO, LoCascio, who previously worked with Bommer at a software company called LivePerson. \nEternos records users speaking 300 phrases and then compresses that information through a two-day computing process that captures a person\\'s voice. Users can further train the AI system by answering questions about their lives, political views or various aspects of their personalities. \nThe AI voice, which costs $15,000 to set up, can answer questions and tell stories about a person\\'s life without regurgitating pre-recorded answers. The legal rights for the AI belongs to the person on whom it was trained and can be treated like an asset and passed down to other family members, LoCascio said. \nBommer has been spending most of his time lately feeding the AI phrases and sentences \""to give the AI the opportunity not only to synthesize my voice in flat mode, but also to capture emotions and moods in the voice.\"" And indeed the AI voicebot has some resemblance with Bommer\\'s voice, although it leaves out the \""hmms\"" and \""ehs\"" and mid-sentence pauses of his natural cadence.\nBommer is excited about his AI personality and says it will only be a matter of time until the AI voice will sound more human-like and even more like himself. \nIn the case of his 61-year-old wife, he doesn\\'t think it would hamper her coping with loss. \n\""Think of it sitting somewhere in a drawer, if you need it, you can take it out, if you don\\'t need it, just keep it there,\"" he told her as she came to sit down next to him on the sofa.\nBut Anett Bommer herself is more hesitant about the new software and whether she\\'ll use it after her husband\\'s death.\nRight now, she more likely imagines herself sitting on the couch sofa with a glass of wine, cuddling one of her husband\\'s old sweaters and remembering him instead of feeling the urge to talk to him via the AI voicebot — at least not during the first period of mourning.\n\""But then again, who knows what it will be like when he\\'s no longer around,\"" she said, taking her husband\\'s hand and giving him a glance. \n"""
"ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay (AP) — It was one of the first actions taken by Paraguayans in public defiance of their overthrown dictator, a military strongman who unleashed a 35-year reign of terror, killing hundreds of people and imprisoning thousands more. \nIn a howl of dissent, crowds massed around the newly elected socialist mayor of Asunción, Paraguay\\'s capital, to tear down a bronze statue honoring Latin America\\'s longest-ruling dictator, Gen.

Residents joke it remains an unwitting symbol of his entrenched presence in Asunción — 70 years ago to the day on Thursday that he seized power in 1954 coup and secured the virtually uninterrupted dominance of his conservative Colorado party. \n\Stroessner planted a seed, and that seed has germinated,\"" said Emilio Barreto, an 84-year-old unionist\\'s son who was among nearly 20,000 Paraguayans estimated to have been tortured and imprisoned without charge during Stroessner\\'s rule. \""Today we\\'ve been through 35 years of dictatorship and 35 years of so-called democracy.\""\nThose who pushed the process of democratization after Stroessner\\'s downfall said they had wanted to believe their country was on the upswing, that its civic institutions were getting stronger. \nBut now activists say they\'ve increasingly seen a trend in the opposite direction. \nIn a rare eruption of public outrage on Thursday, hundreds of protesters streamed through downtown Asunción, raising their fists and chanting, \""Never again, dictatorship.\""\n\""We\'re witnessing a curtailing of civil liberties,\"" said Hugo Valiente from Amnesty International in Paraguay, citing a series of recent government moves that he said \""have the clear purpose of discouraging people from exercising freedom of association.\"" \nA government spokesperson and Colorado party members did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. \nAnxieties about democratic backsliding added urgency to the 70th anniversary — which also marks one year since President Santiago Peña\'s inauguration. \nLeading Thursday\'s protest was Paraguay\\'s small but passionate opposition — including Kattya González, a center-left senator and vocal government critic who was summarily booted from the Senate last February.\nShe had garnered the third-most votes in last year\\'s legislative elections. But in a vote that rights groups said violated due process, she was ejected by allies of former President Horacio Cartes, a powerful cigarette tycoon sanctioned by the Biden administration for corruption who remains president of the Colorado party.\n\""We don\\'t see the popular will being reflected in our representative bodies,\"" González said. \""That\'s why we\'re demonstrating today.\""\nThe government has chalked her expulsion up to the will of Congress, where the Colorado party has a majority. In June, the party removed a lawmaker from its ranks who had similarly spoken out against Cartes\\' alleged corruption. \nLast week, Paraguay even demanded that the United States accelerate the departure of its ambassador after the White House imposed sanctions on a tobacco company that it alleged had paid millions of dollars to Cartes.\nCartes denies the allegations. \nWhen Paraguay\\'s senate last month rushed through a contentious bill that expands government powers to audit nonprofits, the former mayor of Asunción raised alarm, recalling the symbolic triumph of 1991. \n\""Let\'s remember the moment we knocked down the statue,\"" Carlos Filizzola said, \""for its symbolism against what the dictatorship was.\"" \nThe government said the bill aims to boost scrutiny of NGO finances to counter money laundering. Critics said it mimics so-called nonprofit transparency measures in place from Russia to Venezuela that send a chill through civil society. The United Nations appealed to Paraguay\'s lower house to reject it. \nExperts argue that the past is still present in Paraguay because the government hasn\'t reckoned with the legacy of Stroessner, who entrenched the small South American country\'s highly unequal distribution of land ownership and turned Paraguay into a smuggling hub.\nHis enduring influence was never more obvious than in 2018, when Paraguay elected then-President Mario Abdo Benítez, the son of Stroessner\\'s personal secretary who had served as a pallbearer at the dictator\\'s 2006 funeral.\n\""The totalitarian control of Stroessner created a real identification between political party and the state,\"" said historian Milda Rivarola. \""That\\'s what made the Paraguayan political regime so special, the only country on the continent that never really had a progressive government.\""\nParaguay\'s left-wing opposition party held power just once — from 2008-2012 — before its president\'s impeachment. \n\""In our country, this history of the dictatorship is hidden, there\\'s no policy of memory,\"" said Rogelio Goiburú, who oversees efforts to recover victims\' remains for the Justice Ministry and whose father was disappeared by the dictatorship. \nEfforts to bring justice to those responsible for crimes against humanity have been far more extensive in neighboring Argentina, where courts have convicted hundreds of military officers of dictatorship-era crimes and forensic teams have identified 800 victims. \nBut in Paraguay, there have been no blockbuster trials of junta leaders. Public schools — many still decorated with plaques paying tribute to Stroessner — avoid mention of the 20th-century dictatorship in national history lessons. \nThe remains of just four victims have been identified with the help of Argentine researchers. Goiburú said the Justice Ministry commission has no budget or state support.\n\""I\\'m still putting up with everything because of that motto, ‘Never Again.\\' We do this so we don\\'t lose our memory, so this doesn\\'t happen again,\"" he said from a riverside park in dilapidated downtown Asunción. In 1991, Filizzola, the former mayor, named it Plaza of the Disappeared. \n\""That\\'s why we have to continue,\"" he said.\n"""
"TOKYO (AP) — The word \onigiri\"" became part of the Oxford English Dictionary this year, proof that the humble sticky-rice ball and mainstay of Japanese food has entered the global lexicon.\nThe rice balls are stuffed with a variety of fillings and typically wrapped in seaweed. It\'s an everyday dish that epitomizes \""washoku\"" — the traditional Japanese cuisine that was designated a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage a decade ago.\nOnigiri is \""fast food, slow food and soul food,\"" says Yusuke Nakamura, who heads the Onigiri Society, a trade group in Tokyo.\nFast because you can find it even at convenience stores. Slow because it uses ingredients from the sea and mountains, he said. And soul food because it\'s often made and consumed among family and friends. No tools are needed, just gently cupped hands.\n\""It\\'s also mobile, food on the move,\"" he said.\nOnigiri in its earliest form is believed to go back at least as far as the early 11th Century\"
"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bruce Holmes, 65, grew up fishing on the Anacostia River, a 9-mile (14-kilometer) urban waterway that flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland, and has long been defined by pollution and neglect.\nBack then, Holmes would keep what he caught with his family — usually carp or catfish — and take it home to fry. It was the 1970\'s, and he didn\'t know how contaminated the water was.\n\There wasn\\'t no throwing it back in,\"" Holmes said, \""Whatever we caught we ate. Or we sold.\"" \nNow, decades later, Holmes no longer eats what he catches from the Anacostia as he\'s learned more about the river, but teaches adults and children in the capital how to fish as the river undergoes something of a comeback. He hopes the fishing lessons double as a clarion call to help clean up and maintain the river he grew up around.\nSometimes called D.C.\'s \""forgotten river,\"" the Anacostia River is shorter, shallower and harder to navigate than the more famous Potomac, which cuts through the city\\'s storied landmarks and is steeped in Revolutionary and American Civil War history. For decades, the Anacostia was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected the communities of color that the river intersects. \nIn recent years, things have started to improve, but change has come slowly.\nINFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES \nIt\\'s still illegal to swim in the Anacostia because of E. coli levels that test above the threshold deemed safe for human exposure, but in recent years, a $3.29 billion sewer upgrade in D.C. has reduced sewage overflows into the river, keeping large amounts of waste out.\nA series of tunnels drilled under the city capture storm and sewage water that previously flowed into the Anacostia. Since 2018, when the first segment went online, the upgrades have reduced outflows of sewage and wastewater by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\'s water utility. \nLast fall, the final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online. The overall system is expected to reduce overflows into the river by 98%.\nStill, the Anacostia received a failing grade for the third time in six years last year from a nonprofit that grades the river\'s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.\nThe Anacostia Watershed Society tested the river for fecal bacteria, dissolved oxygen — needed by all aquatic animals — and algae levels, as well as the health of its aquatic vegetation and clarity of its water. \n\""The trend line is moving up,\"" said Chris Williams, director of the Anacostia Watershed Society. \""Twenty-five years ago, it was one of the most polluted rivers in the country,\"" he said, contrasting that to the past few years \""where the water quality is pretty steadily improving.\""\nENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE\nFor many involved in the Anacostia\\'s clean-up, the history of the river, its neglect and industrial pollution are inextricable from the city\\'s racial history.\nThe river and the surrounding 1,200-acre (4.85-square kilometer) Anacostia River Park that reaches into parts of Maryland across the D.C. boundary were where communities of color swam, fished and recreated.\n\""Because there are low-income communities around the river, it can seem like they\\'re responsible for the pollution,\"" said Akiima Price, executive director of Friends of Anacostia Park, an organization that works in the communities surrounding the river.\n\""But it comes from everywhere, all over the watershed,\"" she said.\nThat was acknowledged last year when Pepco, the city\\'s utility, reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\\'s history.\nThe payments will be used in part to clean up the river, including addressing contamination from its former power plants. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say. \nTo Price, the work is ongoing. \""There are still challenges,\"" she said, \""but people feel more connected to the river.\""\nMAKING IT SWIMMABLE\nTo help change long-held perceptions that the water is still as polluted as it once was, Anacostia Riverkeeper, another environmental nonprofit, has organized a swim event along a small stretch of the river designated safe for swimming.\nThis year\\'s event will take place at the end of June near Kingman Island, a patch of land in the middle of the river. If the event goes as planned, it would mark the first time in more than a half-century that D.C. residents could legally swim in the river, after the city prohibited doing so in any of its waterways in 1971. Last year, the same event was canceled after a storm raised bacteria levels in the river because of sewage overflows. \n\""It\\'s not lost on me that we\\'re overturning over 50 years of discourse about the river,\"" said Quinn Molner, operations director at Anacostia Riverkeeper. Around 200 people are expected to participate in the swim, Molner said, despite the skepticism her organization encountered when they first announced the event. \""A lot of people that have lived in this area for a long time knew this river when it was not so great.\"" \nHolmes is one of them. A lifelong resident of Southeast D.C., still a predominantly Black and less affluent part of the city, Holmes said he\\'s doubtful that in just a few years, the river in its entirety will be swimmable and fishable.\n\""That\\'s a little bit of a stretch,\"" he said, \""but I can actually say, because I\\'ve been fishing out here for years, I\\'ve seen some big changes.\""\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of a nonprofit that seeks to protect and restore the river to the Anacostia Watershed Society, not the Anacostia River Watershed.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

"TOKYO (AP) — Onigiri is a ball of rice with something inside, similar to how two slices of bread with something in between makes a sandwich. In the same way that just about every American has made and eaten a sandwich, so too have most Japanese eaten onigiri.\nA Tokyo correspondent for The Associated Press is sharing her basic onigiri recipe. It uses umeboshi (salted Japanese plums), but what you put inside can be just about anything — fish, meat, veggies, even cheese — as long as it fits and tastes good. Feel free to experiment.\nShape your onigiri into the standard triangular form, or whatever fun image strikes your fancy. Wrap it with nori (dried seaweed). You can use one big strip of nori or several bite-size pieces. \nThere are no fixed rules. Some people sprinkle their onigiri with sesame seeds. Oboro kombu, or shaved kelp, is another favorite. Or enjoy it plain. \nEasy Onigiri, from AP\'s Yuri Kageyama \nStart to finish: 5-7 minutes\nServings: 5 rice balls (enough for five people, or just one big eater) \n¼ teaspoon salt\n½ cup water \n1 ½ cup Japanese rice, cooked to fluffiness \nThree umeboshi salted Japanese plums (available at Asian food stores\; for smaller umeboshi, use one for each rice ball) \nTwo sheets of dried nori seaweed\nDirections\nAdd the salt to the bowl of water. Wet your hands with the salted water, pick up a handful of cooked rice, still hot but cooled enough so your fingers don\\'t burn. Put umeboshi on top. Pick up another scoop of rice with your other hand, place it on top of the rice and umeboshi. Cup your hands together, squishing gently. Turn a few times in your hands so the rice becomes a slightly triangular ball. Wrap with nori. \nAdd any desired garnishes, such as sesame seeds or kombu.\n"
"NEW YORK (AP) — TikTok and its bite-sized videos arrived in the United States as a global version of the Chinese app Douyin. Less than six years later, the social media platform is deeply woven into the fabric of American consumerism, having shortened the shelf life of trends and revamped how people engage with food and fashion. \nThe popularity of TikTok coupled with its roots in Beijing led Congress, citing national security concerns, to pass a law that would ban the video-sharing app unless its Chinese parent company sells its stake. Both the company, ByteDance, and TikTok have sued on First Amendment grounds. \nBut while the platform faces uncertain times, its influence remains undisputed. \nInterest in bright pink blush and brown lipstick soared last year, for example, after the cosmetics were featured in TikTok videos with looks labeled as \cold girl\"" and \""latte\"" makeup. An abundance of clothing fads with quirky names, from \""cottagecore\"" to \""coastal grandma,\"" similarly owe their pervasiveness to TikTok. \nPlenty of TikTok-spawned crazes last only a week or two before losing steam. Yet even mini trends have challenged businesses to decipher which ones are worth stocking up for. A majority of the more than 170 million Americans who use TikTok belong to the under-30 age group coveted by retailers, according to the Pew Research Center. Whether fans of the platform or not, shoppers may have a #tiktokmademebuyit moment without knowing the origin story behind an eye-catching product. \nWhat made TikTok such a trendsetter compared to predecessor platforms? Researchers and marketing analysts have often described the platform\\'s personalized recommendation algorithm as the \""secret sauce\"" of TikTok\\'s success. The company has disclosed little about the technology it employs to populate users\\' \""For You\"" feeds.\nJake Bjorseth, founder of the advertising agency Trndsttrs, which specializes in Generation Z, thinks the app\\'s use of an interest-based algorithm instead of personal contacts to connect like-minded people is what gave TikTok the edge.\nTikTok also changed the standard for what was considered desirable in social media content. The beginner-friendly platform featured videos made without filters, lighting setups or production-level audio. TikTok creators could develop more intimate relationships with their followers because they appeared more authentic, Bjorseth said. \nThe platform has plenty of critics. Some experts argue that TikTok, like other social media sites, can be addictive and promote unnecessary spending. Others accuse TikTok of encouraging harmful behavior, like girls engaging in skin care rituals intended for older women. \nYet for all the detractors who won\\'t mourn TikTok if it goes away, a vocal base of fans hopes it doesn\\'t come to that. \nFASHION AND ACCESSORIES:\nCasey Lewis, a trend analyst based in New York, said TikTok\\'s clout in the fashion arena first became apparent to her when videos about Birkenstock\\'s Boston clogs overtook her \""For You\"" feed in 2022.\nAs the number of TikTok videos exploded, creators advised their followers where they could find the suddenly sold-out clogs. Lewis thought it was odd since her brother, whom she described as a \""frat boy\"" and not a fashionista, wore the cork-soled comfort shoes in college. \n\""I\\'m not a psychologist, but I\\'m sure there\\'s some psychology where your brain goes from thinking like, ‘How weird? Is that fashion?\\' And then suddenly you\\'re obsessed with it,\"" she said.\nThe pace with which TikTok-shaped trends pop can be dizzying. In the last year, the hot pink ensembles of \""Barbiecore\"" coexisted with the deliberately unsexy looks of \""dadcore\"" — think chunky white sneakers, baggy jeans and polo shirts. The linen-draped \""coastal grandma\"" aesthetic gave way to \""eclectic grandpa.\""\nWhile the rotating cast of \""cores\"" may not drive their adherents to buy entire wardrobes, they\\'re \""influencing spending in small ways, and that adds up,\"" Lewis said.\nDaniella López White, 21, a recent college graduate on a tight budget, said TikTok influencers provided tips on finding affordable clothes but also connected her to plus-size creators featuring fashions for larger-bodied women, which made her more confident.\n\""Those TikTok trends really helped me figure out what parts of my body I want to accentuate and feel cute in, and still incorporate my sense of style,\"" she said.\nFOOD: \nWith easy-to-follow cooking videos and clever hacks, TikTok became a go-to spot for home cooks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The platform made humble ingredients a star and earned endorsements from some of the stars of the food world. \n\""Every day, honestly, I am blown away by the creativity from the FoodTok community,\"" restaurateur and chef Gordon Ramsay said in a TikTok video late last year.\nLike the clothing styles of earlier eras, foods that had fallen out of fashion were resurrected via TikTok. U.S. sales of cottage cheese jumped 34% between April 2022 and April 2024 after videos promoting cottage cheese ice cream, cottage cheese toast and other recipes racked up millions of views.\nBen Sokolsky, the general manager of sales and marketing for Dallas-based dairy company Daisy Brand, said cottage cheese is seeing its highest sustained growth in nearly 50 years. The curdled milk product used to be a \""secret sensation,\"" but social media helped expose new customers to its benefits, Sokolsky said. \nTopics that went viral on TikTok have even spawned analog equivalents. Last summer, TikToker Olivia Maher posted what she called her \""girl dinner\"" of bread, cheese, pickles and grapes. It was a hit, with more than 1.6 million views. A handful of \""girl dinner\"" cookbooks soon followed.\nBut the eagerness to try trendy foods had a downside. A 14-year-old in Massachusetts died after trying a challenge involving an extremely spicy tortilla chip that appeared on TikTok and other social media sites. An autopsy of the boy, who had a congenital heart defect, found that eating a large quantity of chile pepper extract caused his death. Paqui, the maker of the chip, pulled it off the market.\nBEAUTY:\nTikTok has upended the cosmetics industry by causing ingredients to get labeled as the next miracle cure or to be avoided and featuring videos of people gleefully applying or panning the contents of their latest shopping hauls.\nInfluencers on TikTok and elsewhere have made freckles an asset with clips showing how to add faux ones with eyebrow pencils or broccoli florets. The \""clean girl\"" aesthetic, a renamed version of the no-makeup makeup look, prompted both luxury and drugstore brands to rush out their own versions of skin tints and lip oils. \nSome veteran users of TikTok have noted the platform is almost too good in its role as both a tastemaker and a shopping search engine. A popular category of beauty videos shows influencers \""decluttering\"" drawers filled with piles of barely used lipsticks, blushes and eyeshadow palettes.\nThough the desire for clicks can encourage creators to follow the same hair and makeup trends, TikTok\\'s defenders credit the platform with forcing brands to create products for a wider range of skin tones and hair types. \nTiffany Watson, who currently has more than 31,00 followers on TikTok and has done paid partnerships with brands like Colourpop Cosmetics, says the platform has promoted a more inclusive image of beauty compared to other sites. \n\""I see more diversity on TikTok because (with) every video you\\'re swiping, you\\'re seeing somebody new,\"" she said. \n___\nAP journalist Beatrice Dupuy contributed to this report. \n"""
"Ahmed Othman isn\'t on TikTok and doesn\'t want to be.\nHe and his younger sister got iPhones when they were in eighth and seventh grade respectively, but with no social media, just iMessage. Their parents, who are both computer scientists, spent the next year teaching them about social media, bombarding them with studies about its effects on teen mental health. \n\They really tried to emphasize social media is a tool, but can also be like your worst enemy if you so make it,\"" Othman said.\nNow 17, Othman credits his parents\\' deep involvement for what he calls a \""healthy relationship\"" with his phone. That includes staying away from TikTok.\n\""The algorithm is so potent that I feel like, you know, TikTok might not benefit me,\"" he said.\nOthman, who\'s originally from Libya and lives in Massachusetts, is an outlier among his peers, nearly two-thirds of whom are on TikTok either with or without their parents\' permission, according to the Pew Research Center. \nOthman\'s parents took a middle ground approach that a growing number of experts say is the most realistic and effective way of teaching children about social media: Rather than an outright ban or allowing free reign, they recommend a slow, deliberate onboarding that gives children the tools and information they need to navigate a world in which places like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat are almost impossible to escape.\n\""You cannot just expect that the kids will jump into the world of social media, learn how to swim on their own,\"" said Natalie Bazarova, a professor of communications and director of the Cornell Social Media Lab. \""They need to have instruction.\""\nFEW GUARDRAILS\nThe harms to children from social media have been well-documented in the two decades since Facebook\'s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies — though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship. \nMany are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence. They also face bullying and sexual harassment. \nLawmakers have taken notice and have held multiple congressional hearings — most recently in January — on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\\'s founding. \nLast May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a warning saying there is not enough evidence to show that social media is safe for kids and urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use. \nWHEN IT\'S NOT ENOUGH\nOf course, the Othmans\\' approach may not work for every family. Most parents are not computer scientists, and many don\\'t have the time or expertise to create a crash-course on social media for their children.\nBut even when parents are vigilant, that\'s still no guarantee their children won\'t fall prey to social media\'s traps. \nNeveen Radwan thought she did everything right when she gave her children phones: putting restrictions on their accounts, having access to their passwords, taking away their phones at night, setting everything to private.\n\""I made sure that everything was very, very, you know, airtight,\"" said Radwan, who worked in information technology for 20 years.\nHer daughter didn\\'t get a phone until she was 13. She started using social media in the eighth grade. When she was 16, she was diagnosed with anorexia. \n\""We were right in the beginning of (the COVID lockdowns) and it progressed very quickly because we were at home and she was on social media quite a bit at the time,\"" Radwan recalled.\nAn avid athlete, the teen started looking for workouts and ways to stay healthy on Instagram. Soon, though, the algorithm began showing her social media challenges like \""how to stay under 500 calories a day\"" and \""if you want to stay skinny, you need to be able to fit in a baby swing.\"" Within two or three months, Radwan said her daughter was in the hospital. \nToday, Radwan speaks about the harms of social media to teens and has joined a lawsuit against Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. that seeks to hold the tech giant accountable for the harms its platforms have caused to children and teens. Her daughter has recovered and is attending college. \nARE SCHOOLS THE ANSWER?\nWhile parents are definitely part of the equation, most of the the teens and experts interviewed by The Associated Press pointed to schools as the key place where all children can learn about \""digital citizenship,\"" the umbrella term that includes news media literacy, cyberbullying, social media balance and now even artificial intelligence literacy. \nBut while some schools offer digital literacy or online safety programs, these are still few and far between. Some opt to ban phones altogether, but just as with parental bans, kids often find a way around it.\n\""Hope is not a strategy. And pretending that (social media) doesn\\'t exist is also not a strategy, because we have to deal with real life,\"" said Merve Lapus, vice president of education outreach at the nonprofit Common Sense Media, whose digital citizenship curriculum is used in more than 90,000 schools in the U.S.\nTo really connect with kids, he said, it\\'s best to get deeper into the pressures they face when it comes to social media, and validate that those are real pressures. \nNONPROFITS STEP UP\nOver the past decade or so, nonprofits and advocacy groups — many run by young people who emerged from their own struggles with social media — have popped up to offer help. \nLarissa May stumbled on to social media a decade ago when she was in high school. She said she was dealing with depression and anxiety that social media exacerbated. In college, she became \""obsessed\"" with social media and digital marketing, running a fashion blog where she was posting on every day. \n\""I got to a point where I was spending 12-plus hours a day on my phone in my room, more focused on my digital identity than the world around me, my mental health, my physical health, my sleep,\"" May recalled. She almost took her own life. \nThe turning point came when May started going to a psychiatrist almost every day, with clear instructions of what she needed to do: Take antidepressants, start moving her body sleep, and start socializing.\n\""However, I was spending all of my day on my phone, which they never addressed, and being on my phone prevented me from doing all of those things,\"" May said. \nSo, she shut down her fashion blog and started HalfTheStory in 2015, with the intent of gathering stories from young people such as Othman to understand how social media was affecting them.\nToday, HalfTheStory works with young people to build better relationships with technology, on their own terms, starting in middle school even before some kids have a device. \nTo May, abstinence is not the answer to teens\' problems with social media. \n\""What I learn from every single one of our teens is that they wish their parents had more boundaries for them,\"" she said. \""And I think that parents feel afraid because honestly, a lot of violence and conflict erupts around devices.\"" \n"""
"KHARKIV REGION, Ukraine (AP) — Weeks after the decision allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons for limited strikes in Russian territory, the country is having some success in halting Russia\\'s new push along the northeast front, but military commanders are clamoring for restrictions on long-range missiles to be lifted.\nDeteriorating battlefield conditions forced the U.S. to permit Ukraine to use Western-supplied artillery and rocket systems to defend the eastern city of Kharkiv by targeting border regions where the Kremlin\\'s forces assemble and launch attacks. The impact was swift: Ukrainian forces pushed Russian positions back, won time to better fortify their own positions and even mounted small offensive actions.\nBut commanders said that without the ability to use long-range guided missiles, such as ATACMS, their hands are tied.\n\We could target (Russian) brigade command points and the entire northern grouping, because they are located 100 to 150 kilometers from the front line,\"" said Hefastus, an artillery commander in the Kharkiv region who goes by his callsign. \""Normal ammunition can\\'t get at them. With this kind, we can do a lot to destroy their centers of command.\""\nThe Ukrainian commanders interviewed spoke on condition that their callsigns be used, in line with brigade rules. \nThe U.S. expanded the scope of its policy to allow counterstrikes across a wider region Friday. But the Biden administration has not lifted restrictions on Ukraine that prohibit the use of U.S.-provided ATACMS to strike inside Russian territory, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. The U.S. began providing Ukraine with long-range ATACMS earlier this year, but with rules, including that they cannot be used to strike inside Russia and must be used within sovereign territory, which includes land seized by the Russians.\nThat prevents attacks on airfields and military infrastructure in Russia\\'s deep rear, underscoring a common Ukrainian complaint that Western allies anxious about potentially provoking Russia are undermining Ukraine\'s ability to fight effectively.\nUkrainian officials are pushing U.S. allies to be able to strike particular high-value targets inside Russia using ATACMS, which can reach over 100 kilometers (62 miles). \n\""Unfortunately, we still cannot reach, for example, airfields and their aircraft. This is the problem,\"" Yehor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee on national security, defense and intelligence, said earlier this month. \""That\\'s why we are asking (allies) to lift the restrictions to use long-range missiles against limited military targets in the territory of Russia.\""\nSince late May, Ukraine has been able to target Russian troops and air defense systems 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border in the Kharkiv region. Moscow opened a new front in the region on May 10, capturing village after village in a sweeping advance that caught Ukrainian troops unprepared.\nThough not a panacea, the move has greatly slowed Russia\\'s momentum, even allowing Ukrainian troops to make advances along the northeast border, including recently recapturing areas southwest of Vovchansk, according to local reports. Brigades there said high mobility army rocket systems, or HIMARS, were fired hours after permission was granted, destroying an air defense complex outfitted to launch the deadly missiles.\nAt the time, the stakes were high as Ukrainian military leaders anticipated another assault designed to divert troops from other intense battlegrounds in the Donetsk region. First Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Havryliuk told The Associated Press that at least 90,000 Russian troops deep in Russian territory were gearing up for a new assault.\n\""The HIMARS were not silent for the whole day,\"" Hefastus said, recalling the first hours when permission was granted to use the rocket systems. \""From the first days, Ukrainian forces managed to destroy whole columns of troops along the border waiting for the order to enter Ukraine.\""\n\""Before, we couldn\\'t target them. It was quite complicated. All warehouses with ammunition and other resources were located a 20-kilometer distance beyond what we could hit,\"" he said.\nThe dynamics shifted almost immediately, allowing Ukrainian forces to stabilize that part of the front line. Soldiers near a strategic area north of Kharkiv where fighting to push Russian troops back is ongoing said enemy troops had moved positions several kilometers back. Such claims could not be independently verified. \n\""Tactics have changed\"" as a result of Ukraine\\'s improved striking ability, said Kalina, a platoon commander for the Khartia Brigade. Before, they were only able to hit incoming infantry assaults\"
"On a lazy summer weekend a year ago, Russia was jolted by the stunning news of an armed uprising. The swaggering chief of a Kremlin-sponsored mercenary army seized a military headquarters in the south and began marching toward Moscow to oust the Defense Ministry\\'s leaders, accusing them of starving his force of ammunition in Ukraine.\nYevgeny Prigozhin and his soldiers-for-hire called off their \march of justice\"" only hours later, but the rebellion dealt a blow to President Vladimir Putin, the most serious challenge to his rule in nearly a quarter-century in power. \nPrigozhin\\'s motives are still hotly debated, and the suspicious crash of the private jet that killed him and his top lieutenants exactly two months after the rebellion remains mired in mystery.\nA look at the mutiny and its impact:\nWho was Yevgeny Prigozhin?\nPrigozhin, an ex-convict, owned a fancy restaurant in St. Petersburg where Putin took foreign leaders. That earned Prigozhin the nicknamed of \""Putin\\'s chef.\"" Those ties won him lucrative government contracts, including catering for Kremlin events and providing meals and services to the military.\nHe founded the Wagner Group, a private military contractor, in 2014, using it to advance Russia\'s political interests and clout by deploying mercenaries to Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic and elsewhere. Wagner fighters provided security for African leaders or warlords, often in exchange for a share of gold mines or other natural resources.\nPrigozhin gained attention in the U.S., where he and a dozen other Russians were indicted by the Justice Department for creating the Internet Research Agency — a \""troll farm\"" that focused on interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The case was later dropped.\nWhat was Wagner\'s role in Ukraine?\nAfter Putin invaded Ukraine in 2022, Wagner emerged as one of the most capable of Moscow\\'s fighting forces. It played a key role in capturing the eastern stronghold of Bakhmut in May 2023.\nPrigozhin was allowed by the Kremlin to swell Wagner\'s ranks with convicts, who were offered amnesty after serving six months on the front line. He said 50,000 were recruited, and 10,000 of them died in the ferocious battle for Bakhmut.\nThe war added to Wagner\'s reputation for brutality. In a video that surfaced in November 2022, a former Wagner mercenary who allegedly defected to the Ukrainian side but later was captured by Russia, was shown being beaten to death with a sledgehammer, the mercenary group\'s symbol.\nWhat led to the uprising?\nFor months in 2023, Prigozhin complained bitterly about the military brass denying his forces the needed ammunition in Ukraine. In open political infighting, he blasted then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Staff chief Gen. Valery Gerasimov in profane rants on social media, blaming them for military setbacks and accusing them of corruption.\nThe Defense Ministry\'s order for Wagner to sign contracts with the regular military appeared to be the final trigger for Prigozhin\'s extraordinary rebellion on June 23-24.\nHis mercenaries swiftly took over Russia\\'s southern military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, reportedly hoping to capture Shoigu and Gerasimov. But they weren\'t there.\nPrigozhin ordered his forces to roll toward Moscow, saying it wasn\'t a military coup but a \""march of justice\"" to unseat his foes. The mercenaries downed several military aircraft en route, killing over a dozen pilots. Security forces in Moscow went on alert and checkpoints were set up on the southern outskirts.\nAt the height of the crisis, Putin went on TV and called the rebellion by his onetime protege a \""betrayal\"" and \""treason.\"" He vowed to punish those behind it.\nBut Prigozhin abruptly aborted the march hours later in an amnesty deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. The mercenary forces were offered a choice of moving to Belarus, retiring from service or signing contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry.\nPrigozhin later said he launched the uprising after he \""lost his temper\"" in the infighting with his foes. Some commentators said he apparently hoped to persuade Putin to take his side against the military brass — a grave miscalculation.\nWhat was Prigozhin\'s fate?\nOn Aug. 23, two months to the day after the rebellion, a business jet carrying Prigozhin, 62, and his top associates crashed while flying from Moscow to St. Petersburg, killing all seven passengers and a crew of three.\nState investigators have yet to say what caused the crash.\nA preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment concluded there was an intentional explosion on board. Western officials pointed to a long list of Putin foes who have been assassinated.\nThe Kremlin has denied involvement and rejected Western allegations that Putin was behind it as an \""absolute lie.\""\nPrigozhin was buried in his hometown of St. Petersburg in a private ceremony.\nWhat has happened to Wagner?\nSeveral thousand Wagner mercenaries moved to a camp in Belarus after the mutiny. Soon after Prigozhin\'s death, most left that country to sign contracts with the Russian military to redeploy to Africa or return to fighting in Ukraine. Only a handful stayed in Belarus to train its military.\nRussian authorities formed a Wagner successor, Africa Corps, using it to expand military cooperation with countries there. Moscow has emerged as the security partner of choice for a number of African governments, displacing traditional allies like France and the United States.\nElements of Wagner and other private security companies continue to operate in Ukraine under the control of the Defense Ministry and the Russian National Guard. \n\""Despite the spectacular demise of Prigozhin himself and the problems that Wagner got itself into as a result of that, the model — the idea of a private company profiting from this war — is one that is attractive to a lot of people in Russia,\"" said Sam Greene of the Center for European Policy Analysis.\nHow has Putin responded since the uprising?\nPrigozhin\\'s demise sent a chilling message to Russia\'s elites, helping Putin contain the damage to his authority inflicted by the rebellion.\nA crackdown continued on his political foes, with many either fleeing the country or ending up in prison. His biggest opponent, Alexei Navalny, died in an Arctic penal colony in February.\nIn a stage-managed election in March, Putin won another six-year term. In a subsequent Cabinet shakeup, Putin dismissed Prigozhin\\'s archfoe, Shoigu, as defense minister, replacing him with Andrei Belousov, an economics expert. Shoigu, who had personal ties with Putin, was given the high-profile post of secretary of Russia\\'s Security Council.\n\""If Shoigu\\'s new job had been too junior, it would have been humiliating, and could have triggered such criticism of the outgoing minister as to highlight the army\\'s weaknesses: something to be avoided in wartime,\"" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in a commentary.\nAt the same time, Shoigu\'s entourage faced purges. A longtime associate and deputy, Timur Ivanov, and several other senior military officers were arrested on corruption charges, and other senior Defense Ministry officials lost their jobs. \nGerasimov, the chief of the General Staff and another Prigozhin foe, has kept his job so far.\nGen. Sergei Surovikin, who reportedly had close ties with Prigozhin, was stripped of his post as deputy commander of forces in Ukraine and given a ceremonial position. Surovikin, credited with creating the multilayered defensive lines and fortifications that blunted Ukraine\\'s offensive a year ago, wasn\\'t dismissed altogether, and some observers suggest he could eventually be given a new military post.\n"""
"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — In war-torn Ukraine, he is Alya Shabaanovich Gali, a popular doctor with a line of patients waiting to see him. To his family thousands of kilometers away in the besieged Gaza Strip, he is Alaa Shabaan Abu Ghali, the one who left.\nFor the past 30 years, these identities rarely had cause to merge: Gali moved away amid instability in Gaza, settled into his new home in Kyiv, adopted a different name to better suit the local tongue, and married a Ukranian woman. Through calls, he kept up with his mother and siblings in Gaza\\'s southernmost city, Rafah. But mostly, their lives played out in parallel.\nIn February 2022, Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine threw Gali\\'s life into chaos, with air raids and missile attacks. Nearly 20 months later, the war between Israel and Hamas turned his hometown into a hellscape, uprooting his family. \nBoth are violent conflicts that have upset regional and global power balances, but they can seem worlds apart as they rage on. Ukraine has lambasted allies for coming to Israel\\'s defense while its own troops languished on the frontlines. Palestinians have decried double standards in international support. In each place, rampant bombardment and heavy fighting have killedtens of thousands and wiped out entire towns. \nIn Gali\'s life, the wars converge.

"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In a country where racial segregation was once brutally enforced, South Africa\'s new coalition government has brought a Black president and a white opposition leader together in an image of unity.\nYet the power-sharing agreement sealed a week ago between President Cyril Ramaphosa\'s African National Congress party and the Democratic Alliance, one of South Africa\'s few white-led parties, has unwittingly renewed some racial rifts.\nMany Black South Africans have expressed discomfort with a white-led party being back in power, even in a coalition. The country is haunted by the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended 30 years ago but is still felt by millions among the Black majority who were ruthlessly oppressed by a white government and remain affected by unresolved issues of poverty and inequality.\nSouth Africa is now faced with the likelihood of seeing more white people in senior government positions than ever since apartheid ended. White people make up around 7% of the country\\'s population of 62 million.\nThe ANC liberated South Africa from apartheid in 1994 under Nelson Mandela, the country\'s first Black president. Its three-decade political dominance ended in the landmark May 29 election, forcing it to form a coalition. The DA, with its roots in liberal white parties that stood against apartheid, won the second largest share of votes.\nBoth have promoted their coming together in a multi-party coalition as a new unity desperately needed in a country with vast socioeconomic problems.\nBut history lingers. The DA suspended one of its white lawmakers Thursday, days after being sworn into Parliament, over racist slurs he made in a social media video more than a decade ago. Renaldo Gouws — reportedly a student in his 20s at the time — used an especially offensive term for Black people that was infamous during apartheid and is now considered hate speech.\nGouws faces disciplinary action from his party, and the South African Human Rights Commission said it will take him to court. The DA, which previously fended off allegations of favoring whites, is again under scrutiny.\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions, an important political ally of the ANC, asserted that Gouws\\' outburst was symptomatic of a DA that is \soft on racists.\"" The DA \""needs to reflect on and address this if it wants to be accepted as a partner in the government of national unity by ordinary South Africans,\"" it said.\nDA leader John Steenhuisen denied in a television interview that his party is dedicated only to white interests, saying it wouldn\\'t have won the second largest share of votes in a Black majority country if it was. The DA has Black and white lawmakers and supporters, but its only Black leader left the party in 2019, questioning its commitment to Black South Africans.\nPolitical analyst Angelo Fick said the DA does have a \""sense of whiteness\"" in the eyes of many South Africans and has created that by being \""utterly disinterested in speaking to the concerns about race from Black South Africans.\""\nShortly before Gouws\' case, racially charged language came from another direction when the MK Party of former President Jacob Zuma — once an ANC leader — called Ramaphosa a \""house negro\"" for entering into the agreement with the DA. Zuma\'s party also referred to white DA chairperson Helen Zille as Ramaphosa\'s \""slave master.\""\nThe MK Party and the Economic Freedom Fighters — the third and fourth biggest parties in Parliament — have refused to join what the ANC calls a government of national unity open to all. They said the fundamental reason is the DA, which they say is committed only to the well-being of South Africa\'s white minority.\n\""We do not agree to this marriage of convenience to consolidate the white monopoly power over the economy,\"" EFF leader Julius Malema said.\nMalema has sometimes provoked racial tensions in demanding change, once saying, \""We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now,\"" and that South Africa\\'s \""white man has been too comfortable for too long.\""\nHe now says his party is not against white people but against a perceived \""white privilege\"" that leaves 64% of Black people in poverty compared with 1% of white people, according to a 2021 report by the South African Human Rights Commission.\nMalema represents a new opposition to the ANC by many Black South Africans frustrated over the race-based inequality that\'s evident after 30 years of freedom. White people generally live in posh neighborhoods. Millions of Black people live in impoverished townships on the outskirts.\nThat frustration led many voters to give up on the ANC. The concerns about teaming up with the DA could weaken the party even further.\nIn his inauguration speech Wednesday, Ramaphosa recognized the \""toxic\"" divisions that remain decades after Mandela preached racial reconciliation. \""Our society remains deeply unequal and highly polarized,\"" Ramaphosa said.\nThe ANC is trying to use the coalition as a kind of reboot of Mandela\'s ideals.\n\""To us, it doesn\\'t matter whether the cat is black or white,\"" ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said of the agreement with the DA. Mandela had used the phrase to signal he was open to all races serving in South Africa\'s government.\n\""Fundamentally,\"" Mbalula said, \""the question is how do we move the country forward.\""\n___\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa\n"""
"BUSHBUCKRIDGE, South Africa (AP) — The walls of Shadrack Mashabane\\'s hut in the rural South African town of Bushbuckridge are covered with traditional fabrics, with a small window the only source of light. What stands out among the herbs and medicines in glass bottles is a white box containing an HIV testing kit.\nMashabane is one of at least 15 traditional healers in the town who, in a pilot study, have been trained by University of Witwatersrand researchers to conduct HIV testing and counseling in an effort to ensure as many South Africans as possible know their status.\nIt\'s part of the largest known effort in the country to involve traditional healers in a public health goal and study the results. Later this year, at least 325 other healers will undergo the training and become certified HIV counselors. Researchers will compare rates of HIV testing by healers and clinics.\nMost traditional healers were already knowledgeable about HIV — some from personal experience — and were eager to get involved, researchers said.\nSouth Africa has one of the highest rates of HIV in the world. Stigma remains in many communities around the disease and its treatment — even though HIV antiretroviral medication and pre-exposure prophylaxis are free. Concern about privacy at clinics also keeps people from seeking help.\nMany people in rural areas see traditional healers as their first point of contact for illnesses, and the project hopes they can help change attitudes.\nSouth Africa\'s large younger population is a special concern. A government study released in December showed that people living with HIV had fallen from 14% in 2017 to 12.7% in 2022, but HIV prevalence rose among girls between 15 and 19, a phenomenon largely attributed to older men sleeping with them.\nAround 2,000 traditional healers operate in the Mpumalanga province town of Bushbuckridge, home to about 750,000 people, providing traditional and spiritual services.\nMashabane said patients at first found it difficult to believe he was offering HIV testing — a service they had long expected to be available only at health clinics.\n\Many were not convinced. I had to show them my certificate to prove I was qualified to do this,\"" he said.\nThe process includes the signing of consent forms to be tested, along with a follow-up with Mashabane to ensure that patients who test positive receive their treatment from the local clinic.\nHe said breaking the news to a patient who has tested positive for HIV is not that difficult because the illness can be treated with readily available medication. But in many cases, he has to accompany the patient to the clinic \""to make it easier for them.\""\nFlorence Khoza is another traditional healer who has been trained to test for HIV. She said risky sexual behavior is common. She often dispenses traditional herbs and medication to treat gonorrhea, but now she goes further by advising patients to test for HIV.\n\""I tell them it is in their best interest,\"" she said.\nKhoza said many patients fear going to the clinic or hospital and having other community members see them collecting HIV treatment.\n\""In many cases I collect the HIV medication on their behalf,\"" she said.\nRyan Wagner, a senior research fellow with the study, said testing and treating via traditional medicine practitioners could \""ultimately lead to the end of new HIV cases in communities such as rural Mpumalanga, which has some of the largest HIV burden globally.\""\nResearchers hope their findings will inspire South Africa\'s government to roll out such training across the country.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Victoria Estevez finally met someone who saw past her shyness. They spent two months learning about their likes and dislikes, texting about their families and friends, and walking around their hometowns on Venezuela\'s Caribbean coast. On a trip to the capital in December, they held each other for the first time.\nI-like-yous followed, and by February, they were calling it a relationship.\nAnd then came heartbreak.\n\Remember I had told you that I have a brother in the Dominican Republic? Well, I am going to leave the country, too,\"" Estevez, 20, recalled reading in an early March WhatsApp message from her new boyfriend. He was the second guy in a row to blindside her with imminent plans to emigrate.\nNothing, not even love, has been spared the uncertainty that plagues everyday life in crisis-ridden Venezuela, which has seen several million people leave in the last decade or so. As a presidential election looms this month along with questions about Venezuela\'s future, many more are considering emigrating, wreaking havoc on the country\'s economy, its politics and its dating scene.\nYoung people are debating online and among themselves whether it\'s worth it to start a relationship — or whether to end one. Others are wondering when it is too soon or too late to ask the crucial question: Will you leave the country?\nIn a country rife with instability, dating is not spared\nThe last 11 years under President Nicolás Maduro have transformed Venezuela and Venezuelans.\nIn the 2000s, a windfall of hundreds of billions of oil dollars allowed then- President Hugo Chávez\'s government to launch numerous initiatives, including providing ample public housing, free health clinics and education programs.\nBut a global drop in oil prices, government mismanagement and widespread corruption pushed the country into the political, social and economic crisis that has marked the entirety of his successor\'s presidency: Decent paying jobs are rare. Water, electricity and other public services are unreliable. Food prices have skyrocketed.\nThe country that once welcomed Europeans fleeing war and Colombians escaping a bloody internal conflict has now seen more than 7.7 million people flee its shores. The government now faces its toughest test in decades in a July 28 election. \nAccountant Pedro Requena has seen many a friend leave, but the news hit differently when the woman he had spent three \""incredible\"" months dating in 2021 told him she was moving with her mom to Turkey. Requena, 26, was swooning over her, but he was committed to finishing his university degree and did not consider migrating.\nWith no guarantee of when they could visit each other, they still decided to give long-distance a try. They woke up early or went to bed late so that they could have video calls despite their seven-hour difference. They watched movies and TV shows simultaneously. They texted and texted and texted.\n\""Venezuelans adapt to anything,\"" he said. \""The crisis changes you.\""\nIndeed, Venezuelans adapted their diets when food shortages were widespread and again when groceries became available but unaffordable. They sold cars and switched to motorcycles or stopped driving, when lines at gas stations stretched kilometers (miles). They stocked up on candles when power outages became the norm. They used the U.S. dollar when the Venezuelan bolivar became worthless.\nBut that unpredictability is disastrous for forming lasting bonds.\n\""The political instability actually introduces the instability into the relationship or into dating in general,\"" said Dr. Amir Levine, a psychiatrist and research professor at Columbia University. \nA disillusioned generation\nFor many of the young people fleeing Venezuela now, migration was not their first choice. First, they protested, standing on the front lines of massive anti-government demonstrations in 2017, when they were students.\nThe movement was met with repression and sometimes deadly force — and nothing changed: Maduro is still president, well paying jobs are nonexistent, and a car, a house and other symbols of adulthood did not materialize for this generation.\nNow, instead of planning demonstrations, they plan one-way trips abroad.\nHalf of Kelybel Sivira\'s graduating class from law school — including people involved in the protests — has left the country.\nThe 29-year-old commercial lawyer reconnected online with a former classmate in May 2021, after he had already emigrated to the U.S. with his family. Their friendly conversations turned romantic, and they began to consider a relationship toward the end of 2022.\nThey have not seen each other in person for years. He is seriously considering returning to Venezuela in August regardless of the election outcome. She does not want that.\n\""I\\'m afraid that he will return to the country and say, ‘Venezuela, I still hate you. This is not what I want,\\'\"" Sivira said. \""I don\\'t want to feel guilty.\""\nRequena is also in a kind of limbo. Though he and his long-distance girlfriend decided to see other people, he still longs for the person he said was his perfect match.\n\""We keep in touch. The affection is always present,\"" he said. \""It ended, but the future is uncertain, and even more so with this country.\""\n"""
"LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Protesters streamed into Bolivia\'s capital, throats hoarse from chanting and feet blistered from a week of walking along the national highway.\nThe throngs of street vendors in the South American country\\'s vast informal work force ended their nearly 100-kilometer (60-mile) march from Bolivia\\'s mountain-rimmed plains with a call that summoned years of growing anger over the nation\\'s dangerously depleting foreign-exchange reserves: \We want dollars!\"" \nWith prices surging, dollars scarce and lines snaking away from fuel-strapped gas stations, protests in Bolivia have intensified over the economy\'s precipitous decline from one of the continent\\'s fastest-growing two decades ago to one of its most crisis-stricken today. \n\""We can change the country because we are the engine of production,\"" Roberto Ríos Ibáñez, secretary-general of Bolivia\'s Confederation of Merchants, said as weary protesters broke for lunch around him in the capital\'s traffic-snarled center. \""The government doesn\'t listen. That\'s why we\'re in the streets.\"" \nBolivia\'s financial quagmire stems, at least in part, from an unprecedented rift at the highest levels of the governing party. \nPresident Luis Arce and his one-time ally, leftist icon and former President Evo Morales, are battling for the future of Bolivia\'s splintering Movement for Socialism, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, ahead of elections in 2025. \nThe political fight has paralyzed the government\'s efforts to deal with the deepening economic despair and analysts warn that the social unrest could explode in the historically turbulent nation of 12 million people. \nCracks in the governing party opened in 2019, when Morales, then Bolivia\\'s first Indigenous president, ran for an unconstitutional third term. He won a contested vote plagued by allegations of fraud, setting off mass protests that caused 36 deaths and prompted Morales to resign and flee the country.\nAfter an interim government took control in what MAS called a coup, Morales\' chosen successor, Arce, won election on a campaign promise to restore prosperity to Bolivia, once Latin America\\'s mainstay source of natural gas. \nArce had been Morales\' finance minister who oversaw years of strong growth and low inflation, but assuming the presidency in 2020, he encountered a bleak economic reckoning from the coronavirus pandemic. Diminished gas production sealed the end of Bolivia\'s budget-busting economic model.\nStill hugely popular among Bolivia\\'s Indigenous communities, coca growers and union workers, Morales saw an opportunity. After returning from exile, the charismatic populist announced plans last year to run in the 2025 vote — setting himself on a collision course with Arce, who is expected to seek re-election. \n\""Bolivia has an Indigenous majority and people will instinctively support someone like Morales based on what he represents,\"" said Diego von Vacano, an expert in Bolivian politics at Texas A&M University and former informal adviser to Arce. \""Now they have the push factor, the lack of success of the Arce administration.\""\nEarlier this month, Morales drew tens of thousands of loyalists to Cochabamba southeast of La Paz, galvanizing his rural stronghold.\n\""We\'re going to win the elections and we\'re going to save Bolivia,\"" a triumphant Morales bellowed in a stadium filled with cheering supporters waving wiphalas, the checkerboards of bright colors to represent Bolivia\\'s many peoples. \nArce disputes the legitimacy of Morales\' campaign, arguing a 2023 constitutional court ruling bars him from running. \nLegal experts say it\\'s not so clear-cut. \n\""We\'ve seen both the politicians manipulate the courts to decide political issues that have major bearing on the constitution,\"" said Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian judge who served as president in 2005-2006.\nMorales, who proclaimed in his speech that \""we have complied with the rules,\"" has threatened to unleash mass unrest if he is disqualified from running.\nMeanwhile, with the cash crunch denying access to dollars to pay suppliers abroad, Bolivian merchants have produced extraordinary scenes on the border with Brazil and Peru by clamoring to buy the U.S. currency at inflated prices in the neighboring countries. \nWhen exchange shops in La Paz ran dry last year, Bolivians waited in line all night outside the Central Bank to get hard currency.\nIt\'s a striking contrast to Bolivia\'s boom at the turn of the 21st century. Buoyed by a windfall of export revenue, Morales\' government pulled the poverty rate down to 15%, expanded the middle class and built up sprawling cities and roads.\nTrouble began in 2014 when commodity prices plunged and the government dipped into its currency reserves to sustain spending. Then it drew on its gold reserves and even sold its dollar bonds locally. \n\""We ate up the savings and now we are scraping the pot,\"" said Gonzalo Chávez, economics professor at Bolivia\'s Catholic University. \nWith the government forking out $2 billion a year to import heavily subsidized gasoline in an effort to quell public discontent, the squeeze has tightened. The Fitch rating agency in February downgraded Bolivia\\'s debt deeper into junk territory, assigning it a CCC rating.\nAnd the fight over MAS is exacerbating economic woes. \nMorales\\' allies in Bolivia\'s Congress have consistently thwarted Arce\'s attempts to take on debt that would relieve the pressure. Bolivia sits on a treasure trove of lithium, but lawmakers won\'t give Arce approval to let foreign companies extract it. \nArce calls the gridlock an \""economic boycott\"" aimed at subverting his presidency.\nSeeking to ease investor fears, Finance Minister Marcelo Montenegro denies there is any crisis. But the long lines of frustrated motorists outside gas stations suggest otherwise. In recent days, angry truckers have blocked roads and burned tires.\n\""Arce has dismantled our social organizations while abandoning his management of the economy,\"" said Jorge Cucho, an Indigenous leader and activist. \""Prices have increased by 70%. Our salaries are no longer enough to go to the market.\""\nThe tensions tearing at MAS offer Bolivia\'s opposition its first real shot at power since Morales won an unprecedented electoral majority in 2005. Centrist and conservative politicians have jumped into the field. But the opposition is fractured and its legitimacy is in question, with dozens of its politicians behind bars.\n\""The opposition has far more opportunities now due to the division,\"" said Fernando Mayorga, a sociologist at Bolivia\\'s public university in Cochabamba. \""So far, we\'ve seen no signs that it can act on them.\"" \nBolivians who are incensed by Morales but disappointed by Arce say the country stands at a perilous crossroads.\n\""The people are asleep,\"" said Ibáñez, the union leader. \""Soon they\'ll begin to rise up.\""\n___\nDeBre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n"""
"UBERABA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil has hundreds of millions of cows, but one in particular is extraordinary. Her massive, snow-white body is watched over by security cameras and an armed guard.\nWorth $4 million, Viatina-19 FIV Mara Movéis is the most expensive cow ever sold at auction, according to Guinness World Records. That\\'s three times more than the last recordholder\\'s price. And — at 1,100 kilograms (more than 2,400 pounds) — she\\'s twice as heavy as an average adult of her breed. \nAlong a highway through Brazil\\'s heartland, Viatina-19\\'s owners have put up two billboards praising her grandeur and beckoning people to make pilgrimages to see the supercow.\nClimate scientists agree that people need to consume less beef, the largest agricultural source of greenhouse gasses and a driver of Amazon deforestation. But the cattle industry is a major source of Brazilian economic development and the government is striving to conquer new export markets. The world\\'s top beef exporter wants everyone, everywhere to eat its beef.\nThe embodiment of Brazil\\'s cattle ambitions is Viatina-19, the product of years of efforts to raise meatier cows. Prizewinners are sold at high-stakes auctions — so high that wealthy ranchers share ownership. They extract the eggs and semen from champion animals, create embryos and implant them in surrogate cows that they hope will produce the next magnificent specimens. \n\We\\'re not slaughtering elite cattle. We\\'re breeding them. And at the end of the line, going to feed the whole world,\"" one of her owners, Ney Pereira, said after arriving by helicopter to his farm in Minas Gerais state. \""I think Viatina will provide that.\""\nThe cow\\'s eye-popping price stems from how quickly she put on vast amounts of muscle, from her fertility and — crucially — how often she has passed those characteristics to her offspring, said Lorrany Martins, a veterinarian who is Pereira\\'s daughter and right hand. Breeders also value posture, hoof solidity, docility, maternal ability and beauty. Those eager to level up their livestock\\'s genetics pay around $250,000 for an opportunity to collect Viatina-19\\'s egg cells.\n\""She is the closest to perfection that has been attained so far,\"" Martins said. \""She\\'s a complete cow, has all the characteristics that all the proprietors are looking for.\""\nINDIA TO BRAZIL\nIn Brazil, 80% of the cows are Zebus, a subspecies originating in India with a distinctive hump and dewlap, or folds of draping neck skin. Viatina-19 belongs to the Nelore breed, which is raised for meat, not milk, and makes up most of Brazil\\'s stock.\nThe city of Uberaba, where Viatina-19 lives, holds an annual gathering called ExpoZebu that bills itself as the world\\'s biggest Zebu fair. Held several weeks ago, it was a far cry from the Brazil that\'s imagined abroad. The dress code was boots, baseball caps and blue jeans. Evening concerts drew 10,000 spectators belting out their favorite country songs. But the main attraction was the daily cattle shows where cows compete for prizes that boost an animal\\'s auction price.\nThe most prestigious auction is called Elo de Raça, held April 28. As the first cow entered the paddock, speakers blared Queen\\'s \""We Are the Champions.\"" But that cow was a mere appetizer before this year\\'s starlet, Donna, and three of her clones\"
"WASHINGTON (AP) — What if there was a way to peer into your body and spot early signs of cancer and other life-threatening ailments before they became serious?\nThat\\'s the pitch from a new cluster of companies selling high-tech scans to healthy people interested in learning more about their wellness.\nThese whole-body MRI scans aren\\'t cheap. Startup companies like Prenuvo charge between $1,000 to $2,500 for various scanning options, none of which are currently covered by insurance.\nProponents say consumer-driven medical scans are the next logical step in preventive medicine. The industry has received a big publicity push from celebrities and influencers like Kim Kardashian, who posted about her Prenuvo scan last year.\nBut many medical experts say the companies are selling expensive, unproven technology that may cause extra worries and unnecessary treatment, while driving up costs for the U.S. health system.\nHere\\'s what to know before considering a scan:\nWhat is an MRI?\nMRI stands for magnetic resonance imaging. It\\'s a type of medical scan that uses magnetic fields to produce detailed images of organs, bones and other structures inside the body. Unlike many other types of scans, MRIs don\'t use radiation.\nDoctors will order an MRI to help diagnose cancer, brain injuries, damaged blood vessels and other medical conditions. Full-body scans can take an hour or more, with patients lying motionless inside a cylindrical tube.\nMedical societies only recommend routine, full-body scans for certain high-risk groups, such as people who have a heightened genetic risk of cancer.\n\MRIs are great for what they\\'re typically used for,\"" said Dr. Ernest Hawk, a vice president at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \""But now you\\'re moving them much earlier into an average risk population and that\\'s where you can run into these questions that haven\\'t been answered.\""\nWhy are people paying for them now?\nCompanies like Prenuvo say their scans can help identify more than 500 medical conditions that can go undetected at a typical doctor\'s visit.\nThe company charges $999 to scan the torso, $1,799 for the head and torso or $2,499 for the entire body. Several other companies offer similar services and pricing.\nPrenuvo\'s chief medical officer, Dr. Daniel Durand, says customers can decide for themselves if the price is worth it.\n\""We\\'re trying to give people the opportunity to be more proactive about their health,\"" Durand said. \nAlong with the scans and a reader-friendly summary of the results, customers can consult with a nurse or physician employed by Prenuvo to talk about next steps.\nThe company says it doesn\\'t pay for endorsements but will sometimes \""provide a complimentary scan for an unbiased review.\""\nWhat are the potential downsides of MRI screening services?\nMany radiologists say the likelihood of finding a serious problem, such as a cancerous tumor or brain aneurysm, in someone with no symptoms is very low. Instead, scans are likely to flag growths that are usually harmless. Definitively ruling out a problem could require additional tests, appointments and even surgeries.\n\""You\\'re going to end up finding a lot of incidental things,\"" said Dr. Mina Makary, a radiologist at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. \""That\\'s going to create more psychological stress or trauma for the patient, including additional costs for tests and procedures that may have risks.\""\nExperts also worry that people who undergo MRI scans may start skipping other routine exams, such as mammograms.\n\""You\\'ve gone through a scan and it didn\\'t find anything so you say \'Gee, I don\\'t need to do the other routine things my doctor recommends that have been proven to extend life,\"" said Hawk.\nWhat do medical authorities say?\nThe American College of Radiology does not recommend MRI screening in people without symptoms, stating that there is \""no documented evidence\"" the technique is \""cost-efficient or effective in prolonging life.\""\nThe Food and Drug Administration has not approved any MRI machines for preventive screening, but doctors are free to use the devices however they choose.\nThere are examples of imaging practices that were once considered experimental but have subsequently become standard practice. Prenuvo executives say their approach could follow a similar path.\n\""The evidence will evolve over time but patients don\\'t necessarily want to wait 30 years to be in a position to benefit from it,\"" said Prenuvo\'s Durand.\nWhen will we know if MRI screening helps people live longer?\nThe studies needed to show such a benefit would have to be very large and long, tracking a diverse population for years, according to experts.\nPrenuvo recently announced plans to screen 100,000 people and study their health over time. The study isn\\'t expected to wrap up until 2034 or later.\nMost people enrolling in Prenuvo\'s study are expected to pay a $2,200 fee. But eventually academic or government studies could offer individuals a chance to participate in such research without paying out-of-pocket.\n\""This is a great area in which to participate in a research study that might provide the information you\\'re seeking, while also helping answer whether this is beneficial or not,\"" Hawk said. \""But doing so outside of a study makes no sense.\""\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Science and Educational Media Group.

"NEW YORK (AP) — Seriously overdue credit card debt is at the highest level in more than a decade, and people 35 and under are struggling more than other age groups to pay their bills.\nThe share of credit card debt that\\'s severely delinquent, defined as being more than 90 days overdue, rose to 10.7% during the first quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent.\nIf you\\'re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here\\'s what you should know:\nWHAT SHOULD I DO IF I\\'M AT RISK OF DELINQUENCY?\nBruce McClary, ​​​​​​​senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be found through his organization. The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution.\nNonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a helpful breakdown comparing the two.\nMartin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.\n\Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,\"" Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to \""first, relax,\"" and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor.\n\""You\\'ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,\"" he said. \""You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.\"" \nWHAT ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH CREDITORS?\nBoth Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it\'s in the companies\' best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections.\n\""The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,\\'\"" McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. \nMcClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. \nWHY ARE DELINQUENCIES INCREASING?\nThe average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That\\'s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat the highest inflation in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. \nSimultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven\\'t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. \nSilvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind.\n\""Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,\"" he said. \""And high interest rates are having an effect.\""\nTavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with \""buy now, pay later\"" loans, which are increasingly available \""at every checkout.\""\nHOW WORRISOME IS THE INCREASE IN DELINQUENCIES?\nCredit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing income growth. \nAccording to McClary, there\\'s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said.\nOn top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and McDonald\\'s is offering more deals as people cut back.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreaks of mpox in Congo and elsewhere in Africa to be a global emergency, requiring urgent action to curb the virus\' transmission. \nSweden has since announced it had found the first case of a new form of mpox previously only seen in Africa in a traveler, while other European health authorities warned more imported cases were likely. \nHere\'s a look at mpox and how likely it is to spread further:\nIs mpox going to trigger another pandemic?\nThat seems highly unlikely. Pandemics, including the most recent ones of swine flu and COVID-19, are typically sparked by airborne viruses that spread quickly, including by people who may not be showing symptoms. \nMpox, also known as monkeypox, is spread primarily through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions that could make people less likely to be in close contact with others. \nTo stay safe, experts advise avoiding close physical contact with someone who has lesions resembling mpox, not sharing their utensils, clothing or bedsheets and maintaining good hygiene like regular hand-washing. \nOn Friday, Europe\'s Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that more imported cases of mpox from Africa were \highly likely,\"" but the chances of local outbreaks in Europe were very low. \nScientists say the risk to the general population in countries without ongoing mpox outbreaks is low. \nHow different is mpox from COVID-19?\nMpox spreads very slowly unlike the coronavirus. Shortly after the coronavirus was identified in China, the number of cases jumped exponentially from several hundred to several thousand\"
"TOKYO (AP) — Japan, one of the most earthquake-prone nations on earth, issued its first-ever \megaquake advisory\"" last week after a powerful quake struck off the southeastern coast of the southern main island of Kyushu.\nThe magnitude 7.1 quake caused no deaths or severe damage, but the advisory has led to widespread confusion and a lingering sense of worry — in a country well accustomed to regular quakes — about when the next big one will hit. \nThe Associated Press explains what the advisory means, what people are being told to do, and what could happen if a massive quake hits Japan.\nWhat is a megaquake advisory?\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the advisory after concluding that the magnitude 7.1 quake that struck on Aug. 8 on the western edge of the Nankai Trough increased the likelihood of a stronger one.\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake associated with the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, and the probability is now \""higher than normal\"" after the latest quake, the JMA says. \nBut that is not a prediction that a megaquake will happen at any specific time or location, says University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, who heads the JMA\\'s experts panel. He urged people to remain cautious and prepared.\nWhat is the Nankai Trough?\nThe Nankai Trough is an undersea trench that runs from Hyuganada, in the waters just off the southeastern coast of Kyushu, to Suruga Bay in central Japan. It spans about 800 kilometers (500 miles) along the Pacific coast. \nThe Philippine Sea Plate there slowly pulls down on the Eurasian Plate and causes it to occasionally snap back, an action that could lead to a megaquake and tsunami, JMA says. \nThe last Nankai Trough quake off Shikoku in 1946 recorded a preliminary magnitude of 8.0 and killed more than 1,300 people.\nHow damaging can a megaquake be?\nIn 2013, a government disaster prevention team said a magnitude 9.1 Nankai Trough quake could generate a tsunami exceeding 10 meters (33 feet) within minutes, killing as many as 323,000 people, destroying more than 2 million buildings and causing economic damage of more than 220 trillion yen ($1.5 trillion) to large swaths of Japan\\'s Pacific coast.\nWhat is the government doing to prepare?\nAs a result of the \""megaquake advisory,\"" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida canceled his planned Aug. 9-12 trip to Central Asia and announced he would lead the government response and ensure preventive measures and communication with the public. \nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency instructed 707 municipalities seen as at risk from a Nankai Trough quake to review their response measures and evacuation plans. \nExperts and officials have urged people to stay calm and carry on their daily social and economic activities while also securing emergency food and water and discussing evacuation plans with family members. \nIn a reassuring note on Monday, JMA experts said they have so far found no abnormal seismic or tectonic activity that would indicate a megaquake.\nHow are people reacting?\nThe \""megaquake advisory,\"" which is filled with scientific jargon, has worried and baffled people across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled annual events, which has led to challenges for travelers during Japan\\'s Obon holiday week, a time for festivals and fireworks across the nation.\nMany people have put off planned trips and rushed to stock up on rice, dried noodles, canned food, bottled water, portable toilets and other emergency goods, leaving shelves empty at many supermarkets in western Japan and Tokyo, even though the capital is outside the at-risk area. \nThe Summit supermarket chain said microwavable rice is in short supply and the store is limiting purchases to one pack per customer.\nYoshiko Kudo and her husband Shinya said they had trouble understanding what exactly the advisory meant, how worried they should be and what they should do.\n\""We are trying not to go overboard. Too much worry is not good,\"" Yoshiko Kudo said. \n\""We don\\'t know how to be prepared and to still live normally like the experts tell us,\"" said Shinya Kudo, a caregiver in his 60s.\nYoneko Oshima, walking by a major train station in Tokyo, said: \""It\\'s scary ... They say there\'s a (70-80%) chance in the next 30 years, but it could be tomorrow.\"" Her latest purchase is a portable toilet. She says water is indispensable for her diabetic husband, who needs to take medicine after every meal. \n\""I plan to take this opportunity to make a list and make sure we have everything at hand,\"" Oshima said. She hasn\\'t changed her holiday plans this week, but her daughter canceled a planned trip to Mount Fuji.\nIn Matsuyama city on the island of Shikoku, which has many hot springs, hotels and resorts reviewed their evacuation procedures and emergency equipment and launched a radio communication system for emergency use. They have received hundreds of cancellations since the advisory was issued, said Hideki Ochi, director of the Dogo Onsen Ryokan Association.\nRail companies serving the region said their trains are operating at slightly reduced speeds as a precaution.\nA crisis management task force in the coastal town of Kuroshio in Kochi prefecture, where a tsunami as high as 34 meters (111 feet) was predicted in the government risk analysis, initially set up 30 shelters across town. But only two are still open following Monday\\'s JMA statement that there has been no indication of an impending megaquake.\nHigashi Osaka urged residents on the town website not to engage in \""unnecessary and non-urgent\"" travel in case of a major quake.\nThe popular seaside town of Shirahama in Wakayama prefecture said its four outdoor hot springs, parks and other facilities would be closed for a week. Saturday\\'s annual fireworks festival was also canceled.\n"""
"PARIS (AP) — Romania\\'s Ana Barbosu replaced American Jordan Chiles as the Olympic bronze medalist in gymnastics floor exercise after the International Gymnastics Federation restored Barbosu to third.\nThe International Olympic Committee confirmed the reallocation of the medal less than 24 hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport voided an appeal from Chiles\\' coach during Monday\'s competition that vaulted her over Barbosu and onto the podium.\nHere\'s a look at how Chiles, Barbosu and Romanian Sabrina Maneca-Voinea wound up in a scoring controversy that has been painful for all three.\nHow did Jordan Chiles initially end up with the bronze?\nChiles qualified third in women\'s floor exercise and competed last in the eight-woman final, where the order was determined randomly in advance.\nThe 23-year-old finished her routine and was awarded a 13.666, which was fifth just behind Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea at 13.700. \nCecile Landi, who is Chiles\' personal coach and also served as coach for Team USA in Paris, appealed to the judges to have an element restored to Chiles\' routine. Judges approved the appeal, boosting Chiles\' score by .1, good enough for Chiles to earn her third career Olympic medal to go with the team silver she won in Tokyo in 2021 and the team gold she helped the U.S. capture in Paris.\nHow did Romania appeal Jordan Chiles\\' bronze medal?\nThe Romanian Gymnastics Federation asked CAS to review the procedure surrounding Landi\'s appeal of Chiles\' score.\nInternational Gymnastics Federation (FIG) guidelines require coaches to make any appeal of a score within one minute of the score being posted.\nCAS ruled that Landi officially made her appeal in 1 minute, 4 seconds, just past the deadline.\nThe appeal on Chiles was granted, with CAS ruling that Chiles\' score should be dropped back down to 13.666 and that the initial order of finish should be restored.\nSo will Ana Barbosu get the bronze medal?\nYes.\nCAS wrote in its ruling that the FIG shall determine the final ranking, but added that FIG should assign the medal \in accordance with\"" the CAS decision. The FIG placed Barbosu third, Maneca-Voinea fourth and Chiles fifth.\nThe FIG said while the initial order was restored, it was up to the IOC to determine what would happen with the medals.\nThe IOC announced the bronze would indeed go to Barbosu and that it would work with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to have the bronze awarded to Chiles returned.\nThe decision is in line with how the IOC typically views medal allocation. \nAt the Olympics, the governing body of each sport manages the competition and decides the results. The IOC typically accepts that result — once appeals to CAS are completed — and formally awards the medals.\nCan the US appeal?\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee says it plans to try, but it\'s unclear what the exact process would be. The two potential places the USOPC could take the appeal would be to Switzerland\\'s highest court, the Swiss Tribunal, or the European Court of Human Rights.\n\""The initial error occurred in the scoring by FIG, and the second error was during the CAS appeal process, where the USOPC was not given adequate time or notice to effectively challenge the decision,\"" said the USOPC statement, which was released Sunday.\nWhat happened with Sabrina Maneca-Voinea?\nWhile Barbosu was relatively quiet in the aftermath, Maneca-Voinea was not.\nShe used her social media accounts to highlight what she believed was incorrect scoring during her routine. The judging panel dinged her 0.1 point for stepping out of bounds while spinning around to start a tumbling pass.\nVideo evidence seemed to indicate that Maneca-Voinea\'s heel did not actually step on the boundary. The Romanian federation asked CAS to restore 0.1 to Maneca-Voinea\\'s score for a penalty that was given to her \""without basis.\""\nThe request was denied in part because Maneca-Voinea\'s coach did not appeal the score in real-time during the meet.\nWhat do the gymnasts think of this?\nChiles, who left Paris earlier this week to return home to the U.S., went dark on social media shortly before the CAS decision became public.\nThe two-time Olympian had been subject to attacks on her various social media platforms in recent days, with some critics suggesting she give the medal back.\nChiles posted on X not long after the final that \""it\'s funny how some people can still never be happy for someone.\""\nManeca-Voinea put together an aggressive campaign on social media, asking for justice. \nBarbosu asked for calm earlier in the week, blaming the judging panel and not the gymnasts.\nThe Paris Olympics served as a comeback of sorts for one of the sport\'s former superpowers. The Romanian program medaled in the team final in 10 straight Olympics between 1976-2012 before falling on hard times over the last decade. When Barbosu and her teammates walked onto the floor for qualifying on July 28, it marked her country\'s first appearance under the rings in 12 years.\n\""We as athletes don\\'t deserve something like that, we only want to perform as best as we can and to be rewarded based on our performance,\"" Barbosu said after returning to Romania. \""The problems lie with the judges, with their calculations and decisions.\""\nAmerican star and two-time Olympic champion Simone Biles encouraged Chiles — a longtime friend — to \""keep her chin up.\"" U.S. standout and six-time Olympic medalist Sunisa Lee chimed in late Saturday, putting the onus on the judges and calling the outcome \""unacceptable.\""\n___\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n"""
"NEW DELHI (AP) — India\'s medical workers began a countrywide strike Saturday to protest the rape and killing of a trainee doctor at a state-run hospital in the eastern West Bengal state.\nSaturday\\'s strike was called by the country\\'s largest group of doctors, the Indian Medical Association, saying all non-essential services at hospitals would be shut down across the country for 24 hours.\nThe suspension of work has affected thousands of patients across India. The protests — mostly led by women — have intensified in recent days, demanding a safer working environment.\nHere\'s what to know.\nA trainee doctor has been killed\nOn Aug. 9, police discovered the bloodied body of the 31-year-old trainee doctor at the state-run R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital\\'s seminar hall in eastern Kolkata city.\nA police volunteer working at the hospital has been detained in connection with the crime, but the family of the victim alleges it was a gang rape and more people were involved. An autopsy has confirmed sexual assault.\nThe case is being probed by federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation.\nOn Wednesday night, thousands of women across the country protested on the streets, demanding justice for the victim as they participated in \Reclaim The Night\"" marches. Some protesters called for the perpetrators of the crime to be given the death penalty.\nProtesters want justice and safety\nThousands of medical workers across India are demanding justice for the victim and a guarantee of safety for doctors and paramedics inside hospitals and medical campuses. Many of them have suspended all but emergency treatment, with more such strikes planned over the weekend. \nDoctors say the assault highlights the vulnerability of medics who work without proper safety facilities in hospitals and medical campuses across India.\nThe Indian Medical Association asked public support in its \""struggle for justice\"" and called the killing a \""crime of barbaric scale due to the lack of safe spaces for women.\""\nThe doctors are also demanding more stringent laws to protect them from violence, including making any attack on on-duty medics an offense without the possibility of bail.\nIndia has a history of sexual violence against women\nSexual violence against women is a widespread problem in India.\nMany cases of crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women\\'s rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.\nStill, the number of recorded rape cases in the country has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape — a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. \nIn 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders.\nThe rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.\n"""
"TOKYO (AP) — Japan\'s embattled Prime Minister Fumio Kishida surprised the country Wednesday by announcing that he\'ll step down when his party picks a new leader next month. \nHis decision clears the way for his governing Liberal Democratic Party to choose a new standard bearer in its leadership election next month. The winner of that election will replace Kishida as both party chief and prime minister.\nA new leader could help the party shake off scandals that have dogged Kishida\'s government, and some see a chance for the country to select its first female prime minister. \nHere\'s a look at how the new leader will be chosen, and what it could mean.\nWhat happens next?\nKishida announced plans not to run just days before the LDP is expected to set a date for its triennial leadership vote, which must take place in September.\nKishida will remain party president and prime minister until his successor is elected. \nWith the LDP in control of both houses of parliament, the next party leader is guaranteed to become prime minister. \nSome political watchers say the next general election could come soon after the LDP has a fresh leader, who can choose to hold it at any time before the current term of the lower house ends in October 2025. \nWhy is Kishida stepping down?\nA series of local election losses earlier this year sparked calls within his party to have a new face to boost support before the next national election.\nKishida said a series of scandals has \breached\"" the public\\'s trust, and the party needs to demonstrate its commitment to change. \nHe said, \""the most obvious first step is for me to bow out.\"" \nThe most damaging scandal centered on the failure of dozens of the party\'s most influential members to report political donations, and resurfaced controversy over the LDP\\'s decades-old ties with the South Korea-based Unification Church. \nHow will the party choose its next leader?\nMost of Japan\'s voters won\'t have a say as the LDP chooses a leader in a vote that\'s confined to the party\'s 1.1 million dues-paying members.\nThey\'ll vote in a system that divides power between the party\'s elected lawmakers and its membership at large, with each group getting 50% of the vote.\nWhile LDP leadership votes were long seen as dominated by the party\'s powerful factional leaders, experts say that\'s less certain as all but one of the formal factions announced their dissolution in the wake of the party\'s corruption scandals, in a move led by Kishida.\nWho are the possible candidates?\nIt\'s not clear yet who\'s leading the race to replace Kishida, with speculation focusing on several senior LDP members.\nThree of those names belong to women, raising the possibility of a breakthrough in Japan\'s male-dominated politics.\nExperts say the LDP\'s need to change its image could push it to choose a female prime minister. Only three women have run for the party\'s leadership in the past, two of whom ran against Kishida in 2021.\nOnly 10.3% of the members of the lower house of Japan\'s parliament are women, putting Japan 163rd for female representation among 190 countries examined in a report by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union in April.\nHow about the general election?\nThe LDP\'s troubles could spill into the general election, but Japan\\'s fractured opposition may have difficulty capitalizing on the situation.\nExperts say voters may want to punish the LDP over its scandals, but don\'t see opposition parties as viable alternatives. \nThe main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan has scored some victories in local elections this year, in part helped by the LDP scandals, but it has struggled to come up with policies that draw contrasts with the governing coalition.\n"""
"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Key West, Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors and St. Petersburg are among several Florida cities that have long been top U.S. destinations for LGBTQ+ tourists. So it came as a surprise this week when travelers learned that Florida\'s tourism marketing agency quietly removed the \LGBTQ Travel\"" section from its website sometime in the past few months.\nBusiness owners who cater to Florida\'s LGBTQ+ tourists said Wednesday that it marked the latest attempt by officials in the state to erase the LGBTQ+ community. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis previously championed a bill to forbid classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, and supported a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, as well as a law meant to keep children out of drag shows.\n\""It\'s just disgusting to see this,\"" said Keith Blackburn, who heads the Greater Fort Lauderdale LGBT Chamber of Commerce. \""They seem to want to erase us.\"" \nThe change to Visit Florida\'s website was first reported by NBC News, which noted a search query still pulls up some listings for LGBTQ+-friendly places despite the elimination of the section.\nJohn Lai, who chairs Visit Florida\'s board, didn\'t respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Dana Young, Visit Florida\'s CEO and president, didn\'t respond to a voicemail message Wednesday, and neither did the agency\'s public relations director.\nVisit Florida is a public-private partnership between the state of Florida and the state\'s tourism industry. The state contributes about $50 million each year to the quasi-public agency from two tourism and economic development funds.\nFlorida is one of the most popular states in the U.S. for tourists, and tourism is one of its biggest industries. Nearly 141 million tourists visited Florida in 2023, with out-of-state visitors contributing more than $102 billion to Florida\\'s economy.\nBefore the change, the LGBTQ+ section on Visit Florida\'s website had read, \""There\\'s a sense of freedom to Florida\\'s beaches, the warm weather and the myriad activities — a draw for people of all orientations, but especially appealing to a gay community looking for a sense of belonging and acceptance.\""\nBlackburn said the change and other anti-LGBTQ+ policies out of Tallahassee make it more difficult for him to promote South Florida tourism since he encounters prospective travelers or travel promoters who say they don\'t want to do business in the state.\nLast year, for instance, several civil rights groups issued a travel advisory for Florida, saying that policies championed by DeSantis and Florida lawmakers are \""openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.\""\nBut visitors should also understand that many Florida cities are extremely inclusive, with gay elected officials and LGBTQ+-owned businesses, and they don\'t reflect the policies coming from state government, Blackburn added.\n\""It\\'s difficult when these kinds of stories come out, and the state does these things, and we hear people calling for a boycott,\"" Blackburn said. \""On one level, it\\'s embarrassing to have to explain why people should come to South Florida and our destination when the state is doing these things.\""\n"""
"Whether you\\'re a busy professional seeking comfortable transportation, a parent seeking reliability and low cost in a family vehicle, or an outdoor enthusiast needing off-road capability, the used SUV market offers a spectrum of options for less than $35,000. The hard part is figuring out which SUV will be best for you. \nEdmunds\\' experts are here to help with what they consider are the five best-value used SUVs in this price range. Each has an appealing mix of functionality and style plus a proven ability to meet drivers\\' needs without breaking the bank. The following SUVs are organized by category\; their estimated price ranges are what you can typically expect to pay at a nationwide no-haggle dealership such as CarMax or Carvana. \nSmall SUV: Mazda CX-50\nMazda\\'s CX-50 stands out in this crowded and competitive category by being fun to drive and having an interior that rivals luxury models in materials and design. Every CX-50 comes with all-wheel drive too. Mazda released the CX-50 for 2023. If you are struggling to find one that you like, know that the Mazda CX-5 is pretty similar and is more widely available as a used vehicle.\nLook for: Two engines are available for the CX-50: a base four-cylinder engine or an available turbocharged version. The CX-50 Turbo is powerful but pricey. You\\'ll be fine sticking with the base engine. \n2023 CX-50 pricing: about $28,000-$38,000\nMidsize SUV: Honda Passport\nThe two-row Passport is smaller than Honda\\'s three-row Pilot but bigger than the Honda CR-V. It\\'s a tweener that matches what many buyers want thanks to its strong V6 engine and roomy, usable interior. Passports were available for the first few years with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive\; all-wheel drive became standard for 2023. Underfloor storage in the cargo area and many cubbies, bins and cupholders throughout the cabin help the Passport be an ideal family SUV. \nLook for: Get an all-wheel-drive Passport if you can. Besides helping to maximize available traction in wet weather conditions, the Passport\\'s all-wheel-drive system also subtly adjusts power going to the rear wheels to make the vehicle a little more nimble when cornering. \n2019-2022 Passport pricing: about $23,000-$35,000 \nThree Row: Kia Telluride\nKia stunned consumers and reviewers alike in 2020 with the release of this attractive and comfortable SUV. The Telluride offers easy-to-use controls and an abundance of driver assist tech as standard equipment. We also like that its third-row seat is roomy enough for adults. The more expensive Telluride trim levels have features and interior finishes that rival some luxury SUVs. The Telluride\\'s long basic and powertrain warranties are transferable with some limitations.\nLook for: For 2023, Hyundai updated the Telluride\\'s interior and exterior styling, adding larger infotainment screens and two new trims.\n2020-2023 Telluride pricing: about $21,000-$35,000\nLarge: Ford Expedition\nFord\\'s Expedition might be the answer for big families. Though most Expeditions in this price range will have more than 60,000 miles, you\\'re getting a lot of SUV for your money. Literally. The Expedition has standard seating for eight with optional captain\\'s chairs in the second row, which reduce occupancy to seven passengers. And its third row handles adults comfortably. A strong turbocharged V6 engine helps give the Expedition plenty of power for towing a good-size trailer or boat. \nLook for: The Expedition was redesigned for 2018\; get a 2018 or newer model to benefit from more horsepower and a more modern interior. Also, the Expedition comes in two lengths. The larger version, called either EL or Max, has more cargo space.\n2015-2021 Expedition pricing: about $24,000-$35,000\nCompact Luxury: Mercedes-Benz GLB\nWith a traditional shape that produces highly usable space, the GLB offers more utility than many small luxury SUVs. Introduced for the 2020 model year, the GLB is still relatively new and benefits accordingly. It offers a helpful infotainment system, called MBUX, which offers one of the most helpful voice command systems on offer today. The GLB is also pleasing to drive. It\\'s quick to accelerate and has a smooth ride quality. \nLook for: Mercedes offers an optional third-row seat for the GLB. The seat is quite small and not suited for adults but can still come in handy in a pinch.\n2020-2022 GLB pricing: about $25,000-$35,000\n____\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nJosh Jacquot is a contributor at Edmunds. \n"
"If you\\'re ready to move on from a purely gasoline-fueled vehicle but you\\'re not ready to go fully electric, you have two choices. You can get a hybrid or a plug-in hybrid vehicle. But which one is best? The experts at Edmunds will help you decide.\nHybrid Pros and Cons\nA hybrid electric vehicle has a gasoline engine, a small electric motor, and a small battery pack that work together to improve fuel economy, enhance performance, or both. The best-known hybrid is the Toyota Prius, but they come in all shapes and sizes. From compact cars to full-size pickup trucks, there is a hybrid for just about anyone.\nPros\nImproves fuel economy while reducing emissions\nSometimes improves acceleration and overall performance\nOften provides electric-only driving at low speeds for short distances\nUsually doesn\\'t reduce passenger or cargo space\nNever needs to be plugged in\nSmall increase in price, if any\nReduced fueling costs\nCons\nCannot travel long distances solely on electricity\nCannot travel at higher speeds only on electricity\nOverall, a hybrid electric vehicle is a great choice for anyone who wants better fuel economy, reduced emissions, and lower operating costs without any extra hassle or change in their daily routine. Hybrids are more commonly available than ever, and some automakers are rolling out new models only with hybrid powertrains. For example, every version of the 2025 Toyota Camry is a hybrid, and Honda offers certain versions of the Accord, Civic and CR-V only with hybrid power. Hybrid versions of many other popular models, such as the Kia Sportage and Hyundai Tucson SUVs, are also available.\nPlug-in Hybrid Pros and Cons\nA plug-in hybrid vehicle, often abbreviated as PHEV, is a hybrid that offers electric-only driving for a short range and can then be plugged in to recharge. They have a gasoline engine like a hybrid does, but thanks to a larger and more powerful electric motor and battery pack, they can travel at a wider range of speeds in electric mode, for many miles at a time. When the battery charge gets low, the gas engine turns on to continue the trip. You can recharge a plug-in hybrid using a household electrical outlet or a home or public charging station.\nPros\nElectric-only driving for commuting, taking the kids to school, running errands, etc.\nGas-only driving for longer trips\nCan charge the battery overnight using a household-style outlet or in a few hours using a more powerful charging station\nThe gas engine automatically takes over to power the vehicle when the battery charge is low\nCan dramatically improve fuel economy, acceleration, and overall performance while reducing operating costs\nCertain models may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500\nMay qualify for carpool lane access in certain states with only a driver aboard\nCons\nA plug-in typically costs substantially more than a hybrid or gas-only vehicle\nPlugging in each night can seem like a hassle\nThe larger electric motor and battery may reduce passenger or cargo space\nThe added weight of plug-in hybrid components can negatively affect the ride and handling\nIf you don\\'t make a habit of plugging in, it may be less efficient than a hybrid\nPlug-in hybrids are perfect for people who want an electric vehicle but worry about driving range, public EV charging infrastructure, and the costs of installing a home charging station. They\\'re easy to recharge overnight, usually offer enough electric range for typical daily driving, and have a gas engine that eliminates the range anxiety common with driving an EV.\nFor example, you can drive a plug-in hybrid from Manhattan to Santa Monica and never plug it in. Or when you\\'re not taking a longer trip, you can plug a plug-in hybrid in every night and hardly burn any gas in everyday driving, especially if you choose a model with a generous electric-only range.\nIn short, a plug-in hybrid represents the best of both worlds, a perfect bridge from the gasoline past to the electric future. Examples of plug-in hybrids highly rated by Edmunds include the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Hyundai Tucson Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Prime and Volvo XC60 Recharge.\nEdmunds Says\nChoosing between a hybrid vehicle and a plug-in hybrid vehicle comes down to three things. First, do you want the ability to drive only on electricity? Second, are you willing to pay more for a vehicle in order to get that? Third, are you willing to put up with some extra hassle to maximize electric-only driving?\nIf your answers to those questions are \no\"" and your only goal is to save money at the fuel pump, we recommend a hybrid. But if you want to eliminate as much gasoline use as possible without diving into the deep end of the electric vehicle ownership pool, a plug-in hybrid is perfect.\n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nChristian Wardlaw is a contributor at Edmunds. \n"""
Much like film cameras losing out to digitals, the disappearance of the manual transmission from cars seems inevitable. Modern automatic transmissions are better for quick and efficient shifting and, as such, automakers have largely switched to them entirely for their vehicles. The vast majority of electric vehicles don\\'t have geared transmissions at all. Even well-known driver\\'s cars, such as the Chevrolet Corvette, no longer offer one. \nBut fear not, fans of the three-pedal setup: There are still a few new vehicles on the market that allow you to choose your own gears. \nBy picking a vehicle with a manual, you\\'re likely losing out on both acceleration and fuel economy. But what you give up you make back in driver engagement and fun. Edmunds car experts detail their favorite cars, trucks and SUVs that you can get with an old-fashioned stick. We\\'ve listed them in order by price. All pricing includes destination fees.\n\nMazda MX-5 Miata\n\nThe beloved compact convertible has been going strong since 1989 for good reason. It\\'s fun and zippy, and the manual transmission is delightful to use. The Miata is rear-wheel-drive and comes with a 181-horsepower four-cylinder engine connected to either a six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic. Dropping the top to cruise while rowing your own gears is a quintessential driving experience. \n2024 starting price: $30,170 \n\nSubaru BRZ\n\nJust about every Subaru these days is an all-wheel-drive SUV, but not the Subaru BRZ. This is the company\\'s low-slung rear-wheel-drive sport coupe. Co-developed with Toyota and a sibling to the Toyota GR86, the BRZ has the classic sports car attributes of light weight, rear-wheel drive and affordable-for-the-masses pricing. You can get the 228-horsepower four-cylinder with a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic. \nStarting price: $31,315 \n\nJeep Wrangler\n\nJeep remains true to its roots in 2024 while improving the quality and performance of this ageless four-wheel-drive vehicle. Of the Wrangler\\'s four engine options, only the 285-horsepower V6 can be matched to a six-speed manual. Otherwise, you get an eight-speed automatic transmission. Notably, Jeep also offers a manual transmission for the V6-equipped Gladiator midsize truck, which is pretty much a Wrangler with an open cargo bed.\n2024 starting price: $33,890 \n\nToyota Tacoma\n\nRedesigned for 2024, the perennial Tacoma midsize pickup is geared up for a new generation of adventurers. The newest Tacoma includes a turbocharged four-cylinder engine anda six-speed manual transmission, if desired. The automaker also gifted the stick-shift version with a feature Toyota calls clutch start cancel. It allows the truck to start while in gear, a useful element to get going on a steep hill. \n2024 starting price: $35,195\n\nFord Bronco\n\nWhen Ford revived the Bronco with great fanfare in 2021, it also gave it an optional seven-speed manual transmission. You can get it on the base 300-horsepower four-cylinder engine only but this engine has enough power that you won\\'t miss the more powerful V6 much. Ford built the new Bronco to appeal to a variety of tastes, so check out the extensive catalog of accessories for this SUV for everything from camping accessories to winch kits. \n2024 starting price: $41,525\n\nHonda Civic Type R\n\nHonda is one of the few automakers that still bothers to: a) build a small sedan and b) offer a manual transmission for it. For driving enthusiasts, the high-performance Type R version is the one to get. Honda knows how much a manual adds to the experience that it doesn\\'t offer an optional automatic at all. The Type R powers its front wheels with a 315-horsepower four-cylinder engine and comes further fortified with high-performance brakes, grippy tires and distinctive aerodynamic styling. \n2024 starting price: $45,890\n\nCadillac CT5-V Blackwing\n\nBrash, quick and powerful in a way that only a classic American car brand can be, the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing is a souped-up sport sedan. It\\'s equipped with a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 good for 668 horsepower that drives the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or a 10-speed automatic transmission. There are rival midsize sport sedans such as the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz AMG E 63, but none of them offer a manual transmission. America still knows how to rock. \n2024 starting price: $96,990\nEdmunds Says\nIt\\'s not too late to grab one of these peppy vehicles with a manual transmission. But don\\'t wait too long — the list gets a little shorter every year. \n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nKristin Shaw is a contributor at Edmunds. \n

The former is the sophomore feature of filmmaker Rose Glass, who directs Kristen Stewart in a wildly compelling performance as a gym manager who has fallen for a bodybuilder (Katy O\\'Brien) drifter. Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle wrote in his review that it \""gives Stewart a vivid noir sandbox where all of her talent for obsession, desire and rage finds its gnarliest expression yet.\"" The latter is a documentary in which the son of Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss (also the subject of the Oscar-winning \""The Zone of Interest\"" ) reckons with his family\\'s past.\n— And finally Prime Video has the sequel \""My Spy: The Eternal City,\"" in which Dave Bautista\\'s CIA agent JJ accompanies Sophie (Chloe Coleman) on a school trip to Italy where they get caught up in a terrorist plot.

It also serves as the soundtrack to his forthcoming film of the same name. The lead track, \""Lithonia,\"" is anthemic synth-rock, like Glover\\'s own take on Britpop-punk. It was co-produced by Glover, Ludwig Göransson, Max Martin, and Michael Uzowuru. A surprising turn, to be sure.\n— Six of the year members of BTS are currently serving South Korea\\'s mandatory national service.

"The Ford F-150 has consistently been a top-rated truck at Edmunds. Thanks to the many available engines and configurations, the F-150 can be anything from a basic work truck to a leather-lined luxury machine that\\'s capable of trailering sizable campers and boats. Ford has also updated the 2024 F-150 with fresh styling and new technology features. \nBut its success doesn\\'t mean the F-150 has the full-size truck market all to itself. The Ram 1500 is another Edmunds favorite. Known for its smooth ride and outstanding cabin quality, the 2025 Ram 1500 presents an equally impressive résumé for truck shoppers who want a do-it-all truck. This year\\'s truck also receives two new powerful turbocharged engines.\nWhich full-size light-duty truck is the better buy? Edmunds\\' test team experts compare the F-150 and Ram 1500 to find out. \nEngines and MPG\nThe F-150 offers six engine choices for its expansive lineup. They are a trio of turbocharged V6s\; a naturally aspirated V8\; a V6-based hybrid version\; and a thunderous 720-horsepower supercharged V8 reserved for the off-roading Raptor R.\nThe hybrid powertrain is perhaps the most compelling. It makes a strong 430 horsepower and also delivers the best fuel economy. The EPA estimates the hybrid can get up to 23 mpg in city/highway combined driving. \nMost notable for the 2025 Ram 1500 is Ram\\'s decision to discontinue the truck\\'s V8 engine in favor of a turbocharged six-cylinder engine. The standard variant produces 420 horsepower, while the high-output engine churns out a thumping 540 horsepower. The best fuel economy you can get with one of these engines is 23 mpg combined.\nDuring testing, Edmunds found the Ram is quicker. A Ram 1500 fitted with the high-output version needed just 4.7 seconds to sprint to 60 mph compared to the F-150 hybrid\\'s 5.9 seconds. That\\'s a compelling case for the Ram, though the F-150 counterpunches with its better mpg and broader engine lineup.\nWinner: tie\nTowing and Payload\nThis pickup dogfight also takes into consideration maximum towing and payload capacities. The F-150 has a clear lead with its maximum tow rating of 13,500 pounds and max payload 2,445 pounds. Both maximums are with the 400-horsepower version of the truck\\'s turbocharged V6.\nNo one would accuse the Ram 1500 of being a pushover, however. When properly equipped it can tow 11,550 pounds and haul 2,370 pounds. The Ram\\'s best towing number is achieved with its turbo straight-six while the standard V6 delivers the most payload capacity. Both trucks can be optioned with advanced driver aids to make attaching, transporting, and reversing a trailer safer and easier. \nFew truck buyers tow or haul things that will fully push the limits of these trucks. Still, there\\'s something to be said for barstool bragging rights, and that\\'s where the F-150 holds the advantage.\nWinner: F-150 \nDriving and Comfort\nMomentum swings in favor of the Ram 1500 for driving refinement and ride composure. Credit Ram\\'s coil-sprung rear suspension versus the more common, bumpier-riding leaf-spring arrangement found in most pickups. An optional self-leveling air suspension provides an even better magic-carpet-like ride. \nThough the Ford\\'s ride isn\\'t as smooth as the Ram\\'s, Edmunds found it very adaptable to all types of driving environments. The truck feels smaller than it is when navigating snug parking lots and city traffic. \nEquipped with their largest available cabins — SuperCrew with the Ford, Crew Cab with the Ram — there\\'s stretch-out space and storage nooks aplenty. Niceties like heated and ventilated seats with massage functions are available too. \nOverall, Edmunds found the Ram holds a narrow lead in comfort, particularly when fitted with 24-year power-adjustable front seats found in the new-for-2025 Tungsten trim.\nWinner: Ram\nFeatures and Value\nThe value part of this comparison depends on what a truck shopper needs most in his or her vehicle. The basic work truck-like versions start in the low to mid $40,000s. From there, the sky\\'s the limit when you\\'re looking at more expensive trim levels and options. The priciest Ram 1500 is the super luxe Tungsten trim at approximately $89,000. The most loaded-up F-150 is the King Ranch at about $76,000, though the bonkers Raptor R rings in at around $114,000.\nYou\\'ll find the best values for these trucks in the middle of the pricing lineup. Standard features in both the F-150 and Ram 1500 include big infotainment touchscreens, smartphone connectivity and ventilated front seats. They also offer many of the latest driver assist features such as surround-view camera systems and hands-free driving capability on the highway.\nWinner: tie\nEdmunds says\nThe F-150 and Ram 1500 end up statistically tied in Edmunds\\' full-size truck rankings. As such, picking a winner here comes down to your top priorities. The F-150 is more customizable and has higher limits for towing and hauling. The Ram 1500 counters with a smoother ride and a more luxurious interior.\n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

"Toyota has come out with an all-new 2024 Land Cruiser. This latest model of this long-running SUV is smaller and less expensive than before and comes with a hybrid powertrain that gets better fuel economy than the previous V8. Yet, true to tradition, the Land Cruiser comes standard with four-wheel drive and ample ground clearance for help over rugged terrain. It should be a no-brainer for anyone shopping for an outdoorsy SUV. There\\'s just one thing: You might want to get a 2024 Lexus GX instead. \nIt\\'s rare when you have an intra-family rivalry that is as compelling as these two models. The 2024 Lexus GX is similarly new and based on the same platform underpinning the Land Cruiser. It costs more than the Land Cruiser to start but is equally off-road capable, has a more powerful engine, and comes with a third row of seating.\nEdmunds\\' auto experts put these two SUVs in a head-to-head comparison to see which is the better buy.\nEngines and Fuel Economy \nThe Land Cruiser comes with a turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid powertrain that produces 326 horsepower. That robust torque figure helps the Land Cruiser feel responsive at low speeds, though getting up to speed on the highway takes a while. During testing, Edmunds found it needed 8.2 seconds to get to 60 mph. That\\'s fine for routine driving needs, though some shoppers might long for more highway passing power. On the plus side, the 2024 Land Cruiser gets an EPA-estimated 23 mpg in combined city/highway driving.\nThe GX goes its own way in terms of its powertrain. Four-wheel drive is similarly standard, yet tucked under the hood is a turbocharged V6 that delivers 349 horsepower that helps the GX zip from zero to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds. The trade-off is fuel efficiency. Lacking a hybrid setup like the Land Cruiser, the GX gets an EPA-estimated 17 mpg combined. \nEfficiency-minded shoppers might prefer the Land Cruiser but in day-to-day driving the GX\\'s quicker acceleration is more appealing.\nWinner: Lexus GX\nFeatures and Value\nThe five-passenger Land Cruiser lineup kicks off with the entry-level 1958 trim level that starts at $57,345, including destination. It\\'s a bit of a stripped-down trim level, however. The more compelling buy is the midrange trim level known simply as Land Cruiser. Starting at $63,695, it\\'s equipped with more desirable features such as ventilated front seats with synthetic leather upholstery, an upgraded 12.3-inch touchscreen and power liftgate. \nTo get the GX 550, you\\'ll only need to pay about the same amount as for that midrange Land Cruiser: $64,250. This base Premium trim comes with a comparable amount of standard features as the midrange Land Cruiser. As a luxury model, the GX also offers a lot more high-end features than the Land Cruiser, including an available premium Mark Levinson sound system and massaging front seats. Of course, these features come at a price\; the top GX trims are close to $80,000. \nUltimately, the price gap between these two SUVs is closer than you might think, and both offer solid value.\nWinner: tie\nDriving and Comfort\nHaving body-on-frame construction makes the Land Cruiser and GX highly capable when paved roads end. Thankfully, on-pavement driving manners are commendable too. Their upright designs and large windows provide excellent outward visibility. The front seats are supportive in both, though Edmunds found their second rows have less legroom than expected in vehicles this size. \nWhen driven at a more sedate pace, body control is good and a step above similarly outdoorsy rivals like the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco. Compared to the Land Cruiser, the GX does hold key advantages in terms of speedier acceleration and greater stability during hard braking. And while neither feels particularly nimble during spirited cornering, the Lexus\\' suspension feels a little more refined. \nWinner: Lexus GX\nCargo Space and Towing\nThe GX is the only one of the two SUVs with a third row of seating. One hitch is that they\\'re very small and really only suitable for small kids. When occupied, cargo room shrinks to only 10.3 cubic feet, though this expands to a more usable 40.2 cubic feet in capacity with the third row folded. Open up the back of the Land Cruiser and you\\'ll have 37.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats. \nTowing is where the Lexus GX has an advantage. It is rated to pull up to 9,096 pounds when properly equipped. The Land Cruiser tops out at 6,000 pounds. \nWinner: Lexus GX\nEdmunds Says\nBoth of these SUVs impress with their above-average off-road capability. The Land Cruiser has appeal because of its heritage-based styling and lower starting price. But compare it to the GX and you\\'ll find that paying just a bit more gets you a notably better SUV.\n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

"Buying a midsize truck can be a smart choice if you want a truck that\\'s capable but less expensive and more maneuverable than the typical full-size truck. There are quite a few options available and among them are two domestic headliners: the Chevrolet Colorado and Ford Ranger. \nBoth trucks have been recently rdesigned and dramatically improved. They\\'re also about as evenly matched as you can get, so much so that only one-tenth of a point separates them in Edmunds\\' midsize truck rankings. You could be happy with either one yet they differ in small ways that could tip the balance based on your needs. Edmunds\\' experts break down the attributes that will help you decide which is best for you. \nPOWER AND FUEL ECONOMY\nThe Ranger offers a trio of muscular engines, starting with a 270-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder, followed by a larger 315-horsepower turbo V6. Even the base engine is surprisingly powerful for standard truck duties\; for the true need-for-speed types, there is also off-road-focused Ranger Raptor trim that packs a 405-horsepower turbo V6. \nChevy doesn\\'t offer quite as extensive of a lineup. The Colorado has just a single turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 237 horsepower\; an upgraded version is also available with 310 horsepower. Even the base engine makes plenty of low-end power that\\'s useful both for towing and keeping pace with city traffic. In Edmunds\\' testing, the four-cylinder Ranger and the Colorado with its more powerful engine both accelerated from zero to 60 mph in a quick 6.7 seconds. \nAt its best, the four-cylinder Ranger gets an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined in both rear- and four-wheel drive. The Colorado gets slightly lower estimates, with a base four-cylinder rated at 22 mpg combined for rear-wheel drive or 20 mpg combined for four-wheel drive. While the Colorado easily satisfies, the Ranger offers more variety, more power and better efficiency.\nWinner: Ranger\nTOWING AND PAYLOAD\nProperly equipped, the Colorado\\'s can tow up to 7,700 pounds or haul up to 1,684 pounds. The Ranger tows slightly less — 7,500 pounds — but can haul more at 1,805 pounds. In real terms, both trucks are easily capable of pulling motorcycle trailers, small to midsize camper trailers, or many boats with ease.\nThere are a few minor differences that give the Ranger an advantage. Both trucks offer available tow packages that come with a trailer brake controller. This is a feature that allows you to adjust your trailer\\'s brakes from inside the cab. Also, the Ranger\\'s bed is slightly wider at 48 inches between the wheelwells, enough to fit a standard sheet of plywood. The Colorado\\'s bed is narrower by about 3 inches. \nWinner: Ranger \nOFF-ROAD CAPABILITY\nGetting a stock truck that can perform in the dirt has never been easier. The Colorado\\'s Trail Boss trim starts you out with all-terrain tires and a raised suspension, while the ZR2 takes it further with more aggressive tires, upgraded shock absorbers, an even taller stance, and locking front and rear differentials. Chevy also offers a ZR2 Bison Edition that has even bigger tires and additional underbody protection. \nFor its part, Ford offers just one off-road version: the Ranger Raptor. But with its 405-horsepower engine, big all-terrain tires, and Fox racing-style shocks, the Raptor is a premier dirt and desert runner. The Raptor isn\\'t built so much for climbing tricky terrain — although it can do that, too — as it is crossing dirt, mud, dust and washboard roads at speed. \nWinner: tie \nTECHNOLOGY AND VALUE\nInside the cab, the Colorado\\'s 11.3-inch touchscreen offers more real estate than the Ranger\\'s 10-inch display, and it\\'s underpinned by faster Android-based software that includes Google voice assistant. The Ranger offers a larger 12-inch vertical display but it only comes standard on the well-equipped Lariat and Raptor trims. The Ranger also buries some basic functions, such as climate controls, within the touchscreen rather than having them be easier-to-use physical buttons. \nThe Colorado is also less expensive, at least initially. Pricing starts at $31,095 for a rear-wheel-drive Colorado WT, including destination. For the least expensive Ranger XL, you\\'re looking at $34,315. There\\'s a big price difference between the top Colorado ZR2 and Ford Ranger Raptor too. But dig deeper and you\\'ll notice that Ford generally equips the Ranger\\'s trim levels with more standard features to justify the price\; adding those features through various option packages on the Colorado closes the gap considerably. Ultimately, though, we like that Chevy gives shoppers a lower entry point and more ways to get a truck exactly how they want. \nWinner: Colorado\nEDMUNDS SAYS \nThe Ranger tops a majority of the categories in this round-up and stands as Edmunds\\' top-rated midsize truck. But this contest is so close that we can easily understand why you\\'d want to get a Colorado instead. \n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nDan Frio is a contributor at Edmunds. \n"
"Now is a great time to purchase a used electric vehicle. The average price for a used EV has dropped about 20% compared to this time last year, according to Edmunds transaction data. To top it off, you can qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $4,000 if you purchase an EV for $25,000 or less. To help with your search, Edmunds\\' car experts have rounded up five of their favorite used EVs. The average prices below are what you can expect to pay at a nationwide no-haggle dealership such as CarMax or Carvana. \n\nChevrolet Bolt EV\n\nThe Chevrolet Bolt EV could be a great choice if you\\'re searching for an inexpensive used EV. Older Bolts can be quite affordable, especially if you get one that qualifies for the $4,000 tax credit. Chevy produced the Bolt through 2023. The Bolt EV boasts a spacious cabin and an EPA-estimated driving range of 259 miles, which is quite good for an older EV. On the downside, the Bolt can\\'t charge very fast at public fast-charging stations. \nLook for: Bolts from 2022 and 2023 received fresh styling and improved tech features. There\\'s also a SUV model called the Bolt EUV that was available from 2022 to 2023. 2017-2022 models have a battery recall, so make sure it\\'s been addressed in the one you\\'re interested in. \n2017-2023 pricing: approximately $15,000 to $25,000\n\nHyundai Ioniq 5\n\nThe Ioniq 5 isn\\'t an average-looking SUV\; it almost resembles a futuristic Volkswagen GTI with its sporty retro-modern look. But it still performs SUV duties thanks to ample passenger space, available all-wheel drive, and a user-friendly comfortable interior. It\\'s also one of the quickest-charging electric SUVs at a public fast-charging station. We just wish it had a larger cargo area. \nLook for: The Ioniq 5 came out for the 2022 model year. There are plenty of used examples but not as many as the Tesla Model Y. Ideally, you\\'ll want to get any Ioniq 5 that isn\\'t the Standard Range model. This entry-level version is the slowest and has the least range. \n2022-2023 pricing: approximately $28,500 to $38,000\n\nTesla Model Y\n\nThe popular Model Y flexes its SUV prowess with lots of available cargo space and roomy seating. Some used models have a third row, but it\\'s small. The majority of used examples are Long Range models that deliver about 300 miles of range\; Standard Range and Performance models provide less. Having access to Tesla\\'s national charging network is a huge plus, but smartphone connectivity options are limited. \nLook for: It shouldn\\'t be hard to find one below $30,000 but finding one that qualifies for the tax credit might be difficult. Regular used car dealers stock many Model Ys. You can also buy one directly through Tesla. Doing so gets you an additional one-year/10,000-mile warranty. \n2020-2023 pricing: approximately $29,000 to $41,000\n\nFord F-150 Lightning\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lighting provides what most truck shoppers want: a regular truck. The Lightning is basically an F-150 SuperCrew with two electric motors instead of a gas engine. The Lightning\\'s powertrain provides all-wheel drive and plenty of power including an impressive 775 lb-ft of torque. It\\'s also roomy and comfortable, and it offers lots of tech features and can even power electronics. \nLook for: The Lightning debuted for the 2022 model year and has a driving range of 230 to 320 miles depending on the battery pack size you get. But the range drops significantly when towing. The average price is a little high but most used models are the pricey Lariat trim. Aim for an XLT trim if you\\'re looking for a deal. \n2022-2023 pricing: approximately $44,000 to $60,000\n\nBMW iX\n\nIf you can look past that bucktooth grille, the iX is an exceptional EV and one of our favorite electric SUVs. Luxury SUV shoppers will be pleased with its roomy and comfortable cabin, robust power and distinctive interior design. As with most BMWs, the iX offers a long list of luxury and tech features. A third row is unfortunately not offered, and some controls can be frustrating to use. \nLook for: All iX versions have a dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain. The base xDrive50i has plenty of power and can go more than 300 miles on a charge. There\\'s little reason to spring for the more expensive M60 model. \n2022-2023 pricing: approximately $54,000 to $72,000 \nEdmunds says \nBuying a used EV is a great way to save money. But as with any used vehicle purchase you\\'ll want to do your own research to find the best deal and vehicle.\n____\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nMichael Cantu is a contributor at Edmunds. \n"
"When the days get long and the mountains, lakes and campgrounds beckon, you need a vehicle that can pull what you might call the Toys of Summer. Big boats, motorcycles and travel-trailers require muscle to move over hills and highways. A pickup truck will obviously do the job, but a SUV is better suited to also comfortably accommodate your kids, pets and associated gear. Here is what Edmunds\\' experts have gathered for today\\'s best three-row SUVs with the brawniest towing limits. With most small boats and camping trailers topping out at around 8,000-9,000 pounds, any of these picks can get you on the road to adventure in no time. All prices include the destination charge.\n\nJeep Wagoneer\n\nYou might not have guessed a Jeep to be a top-towing SUV, but the Wagoneer isn\\'t a typical Jeep. Jeep introduced its three-row Wagoneer a few years ago and the 2024 model comes with a powerful turbocharged six-cylinder engine. With it, the Wagoneer can tow up to 10,000 pounds. Other attributes include an upscale cabin and an available backup camera that lets you zoom in to help when aligning hitch and trailer. Jeep also sells a Wagoneer L version that is longer and provides significantly more cargo space. \n2024 Jeep Wagoneer starting price: $64,945\n\nToyota Sequoia\n\nToyota recently redesigned its Sequoia, and the results are impressive. As with its predecessors, the latest Sequoia is a truck-based three-row SUV. But it also has a comfortable ride and comes with a V6-based hybrid powertrain that\\'s both robust and respectably fuel efficient. The Sequoia can tow up to 9,520 pounds, making it the second-most capable big SUV on our list. Toyota\\'s big SUV also offers technology to make towing easier, including a load-leveling air suspension, tow modes that optimize gear shifts, and multiple bird\\'s-eye and side-view camera angles. \n2024 Toyota Sequoia starting price: $63,125\n\nFord Expedition\n\nThe Expedition is one of Edmunds\\' top-rated large SUVs. It looks great, it\\'s loaded with technology, and the interior is cavernous, especially in the longer Max model. The Expedition can also tow up to 9,300 pounds. Like the Sequoia, the Expedition offers features to reduce towing anxiety, including trailer sway control, backup guidance, and the ability to reverse a trailer by twisting a knob on the console rather than using the steering wheel. At less than $60,000 to start, the Expedition is also somewhat of a bargain. \n2024 Ford Expedition starting price: $57,625\n\nChevrolet Suburban\n\nThe Suburban has been a family road-trip staple for nearly a century. Today\\'s model is big, roomy, muscular and capable of carrying ample cargo. Maxing out at 8,300 pounds, the Suburban can\\'t tow quite as much as its main rivals. But a forthcoming refresh for 2025 offers innovative towing aids such as trailer-tire monitoring and turn-path guidance to keep your cornering smooth. There\\'s also Boat Ramp Assist to minimize the stress of launching or retrieving a boat. The Suburban can also be a fuel economy champ thanks to its available diesel-powered engine that gets up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg in combined driving.\n2024 Chevrolet Suburban starting price: $61,195 \n\nRivian R1S\n\nFeeling electric? With a respectable rating of 7,700 pounds, the R1S can tow less than its gas-powered peers, but it\\'s still a very capable electric SUV. It out-muscles the rival Tesla Model X by nearly 3,000 pounds. While not Suburban-sized, the R1S offers seats for seven, ample cargo space, an extra front trunk, an air suspension and clever interior storage. But EV batteries work hard when towing. In Edmunds\\' testing with an electric pickup, we found towing sapped nearly 30% of our range. Another catch? The R1S starts at around $76,000 with just 270 miles of range\; you\\'ll need to pay more to get a bigger battery with more range. Still, if you want to go electric and take toys, the R1S is the best choice. \n2024 Rivian R1S starting price: $77,700\nEdmunds Says \nWhether your summer plans include boats, big bikes or boondocking, today\\'s top three-row SUVs offer the muscle and tech to tow your toys with ease. \n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nDan Frio is a contributor at Edmunds. \n"
The average transaction price for a new vehicle was $46,992 in the first quarter of this year, according to Edmunds transaction data. That\\'s out of reach of a lot of car shoppers. While buying a used vehicle can be a more affordable alternative, there\\'s understandably a lot of appeal to buying new and getting a full factory warranty. So what are the cheapest cars and SUVs out right now? The car experts at Edmunds rounded up five possible options. The following vehicles are ordered by their starting price, including the destination fee. \n\nNisan Versa\n\nThe most affordable vehicle in the market — albeit by $20 — is Nissan\\'s subcompact sedan. That low price is for the base S trim level with a five-speed manual transmission. If you want an automatic transmission, it will cost you an extra $1,670. Standard features include a 7-inch touchscreen display, cruise control, and a few advanced driver aids like front and rear automatic braking and lane departure warning. That\\'s pretty good but you need to add the S+ package or get the midlevel SV trim for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.\nThe little Versa is a solid choice for a car. It\\'s very fuel-efficient and comfortable, and it drives well and has a large trunk for its size. But as with most affordable cars, it has sluggish acceleration. \n2024 Versa starting price: $17,820\n\nMitsubishi Mirage\n\nThe Mirage hatchback is the least expensive car with an automatic transmission, but we don\\'t recommend it. The Mirage wasn\\'t a good car when it was introduced 10 years ago, and it\\'s essentially the same car in 2024. Its underpowered and noisy engine results in very slow acceleration. In addition, its interior is chintzy, build quality is poor, and lots of noise and vibration enter the cabin while driving. \nOn the plus side, the little Mitsubishi is fuel-efficient and has a long warranty. Standard features on the base ES model include a 7-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and front automatic emergency braking. The Mirage G4 is the sedan version that costs $1,100 more. \n2024 Mirage starting price: $17,840\n\nKia Forte\n\nWith the subcompact Rio discontinued last year, the Forte is now Kia\\'s most affordable car. As with most Kias, the compact sedan offers a lot of value. The base LX trim comes equipped with an 8-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a few advanced driver aids including lane departure mitigation. For another $1,000, we\\'d go for the LXS trim level with the Technology package for the added advanced driver aids and upgraded wheels and interior. \nThe Forte also boasts a sizable trunk and offers lots of available tech features. It\\'s also fuel-efficient and has a great warranty. However, the Forte\\'s rear seats are small and its ride can sometimes feel uncomfortably stiff over bumps. \n2024 Forte starting price: $21,145\n\nHyundai Venue\n\nThe Venue is currently the least expensive SUV you can buy, just barely beating out the Chevy Trax. It\\'s a subcompact SUV with a relatively small interior. All-wheel drive isn\\'t available. And as with most lower-priced vehicles, acceleration is leisurely. \nOn the upside, the base SE trim level comes generously equipped with alloy wheels, an 8-inch touchscreen display, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, and a few advanced driver aids such as lane departure mitigation. The Venue is comfortable, provides ample cargo space for most, and has a practical and well-laid-out interior with an easy-to-use infotainment system. \n2024 Venue starting price: $21,295\n\nChevrolet Trax\n\nThe Trax is larger than the Venue and offers a lot for the money. Its 2024 redesign made it significantly better than the previous Trax. It provides roomy seating in both rows and has more cargo space than most rivals. Its interior is well designed and offers some of the best tech features on the list. All-wheel drive isn\\'t available, but otherwise you\\'re getting a pretty compelling and inexpensive vehicle.\nThe base LS trim\\'s standard features are similar to the ones found in the Venue and Forte. It also has wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. If you can afford another $2,000, we recommend the LT trim that adds several more features including an impressive-looking 11-inch touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster.\n2025 Trax starting price: $21,495\nEdmunds Says\nMitsubishi Mirage. If these vehicles are still outside of your budget, consider a used or certified pre-owned vehicle, but they typically have higher interest rates.\n____\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nMichael Cantu is a contributor at Edmunds. \n
More than ever, buying a hybrid vehicle makes a lot of sense. The latest models are just as powerful — in some cases, more powerful — as related gas-only models and have such small price premiums that it\\'s easy to start saving money while reducing your vehicle-based carbon emissions. But what to choose, especially when you\\'re on a tight budget? Consider a hybrid sedan. Compared to an SUV, they typically get better mileage and have a lower starting price. Edmunds\\' experts highlight six of the top new hybrid sedans on sale today for under $35,000. They are ordered below by price including the destination charge. \n\n2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid\n\nLooking for great value? The 2024 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid has the lowest price tag in this category while also piling on a five-year/60,000-mile basic, 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Toyota and Honda can\\'t beat that. This hybrid version of Hyundai\\'s small sedan also boasts up to an EPA-estimated 54 mpg combined and comes nicely equipped with many helpful technology features. The main drawback is a lack of power: The 139-horsepower hybrid engine makes passing or accelerating up to highway speeds a bit belabored. \nBase starting price: $27,400\n\n2024 Toyota Prius\n\nThe 2024 Toyota Prius is Edmunds\\' top-rated hybrid sedan for good reason. Easily identified by its sleek new profile, the latest Prius gets up to an EPA-estimated 57 mpg combined. It\\'s also a lot more powerful than the Elantra Hybrid — it makes up to 196 horsepower — and can be equipped with all-wheel drive to help enhance traction in wintery weather conditions. The Prius has a hatchback-style trunk that makes loading cargo easy. However, the actual cargo area is a little small, and the Prius\\' rear seat isn\\'t as roomy as the Elantra\\'s. \nBase starting price: $29,045\n\n2025 Toyota Camry\n\nNumerically tied on Edmunds\\' list of best hybrid sedans is the 2025 Toyota Camry. The Camry is fully redesigned this year and comes with a hybrid powertrain as standard. That means every Camry is now a Camry hybrid. It gets up to 52 mpg and still has all of the qualities you expect of a Camry, including roomy seating and a no-nonsense driving demeanor. All-wheel drive is available too. Some drivers might find seat comfort a bit lacking, but overall the Camry is an excellent choice. \nBase starting price: $29,495\n\n2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid\n\nSpacious and sleek, the 2024 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is refreshed for this model year. Hyundai bestowed its midsize sedan with a full-width headlight bar that gives the Sonata Hybrid a stylish look. Under the hood is a hybrid powertrain that gets up to 47 mpg combined. All-wheel drive isn\\'t available, however, and acceleration isn\\'t quite as snappy as the Camry\\'s. Inside, you\\'ll find a big center touchscreen that\\'s easy to use along with many standard features. And as with the Elantra, the Sonata is backed by a long warranty. \nBase starting price: $31,950\n\n2024 Honda Accord\n\nThe 2024 Honda Accord is a jack-of-all-trades sedan that is as at home ferrying kids to soccer practice as it is transporting a single professional around town. Ever since the Accord\\'s last redesign, Honda has made the hybrid powertrain standard on the Accord\\'s more expensive trim levels. That results in a higher starting price than the Camry or Sonata, though you do get a well-equipped Accord in the process. EPA-estimated fuel economy is up to 48 mpg combined, and the Accord is the quickest-accelerating hybrid sedan on our list. All-wheel drive isn\\'t available.\nBase starting price: $33,990\n\n2025 Honda Civic\n\nHold the phone, because Honda is making a hybrid powertrain available in the 2025 Civic. It will come with the same hybrid powertrain as the Accord and will get up to 50 mpg combined. You\\'ll also be able to get the hybrid in the Civic sedan or the Civic hatchback. But similar to the Accord, Honda will only equip the Civic\\'s top trim levels with the hybrid. The 2025 Civic should be arriving at dealerships this month.\nBase starting price: $29,845\nEdmunds Says \nEach of these sedans gets excellent fuel efficiency and comes well equipped with features. The Prius continues to be the best choice for maximum mpg, but the other cars aren\\'t far behind and offer more interior space.\n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nKristin Shaw is a contributor at Edmunds. \n
Driving a new SUV and saving money at the pump is possible, and you don\\'t need to get a hybrid or electric vehicle. From small crossovers to large traditional SUVs, there are fuel-efficient models on sale now that don\\'t require paying a premium for electrification.\nBased on official fuel economy ratings set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the five SUV models listed below are tops in their class for gas mileage. They\\'re all also available with all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive to enhance traction in foul weather driving. Edmunds\\' car experts dive into what stands out about each. The listed pricing includes destination charges. \n\nExtra-Small SUV: Toyota Corolla Cross\n\nWith an SUV body style and Corolla mechanicals, the Toyota Corolla Cross is one of the most popular small SUVs you can buy. Pleasingly, that extra interior space doesn\\'t come at the expense of fuel economy because this crossover gets up to an EPA-estimated 32 mpg in combined driving. A 169-horsepower four-cylinder engine moves the metal, and there is up to 24 cubic feet of cargo space behind the Corolla Cross\\' back seat. All-wheel drive is available on every trim level.\n2024 Corolla Cross starting price: $25,210\n\nSmall SUV: Nissan Rogue\n\nYou have plenty to choose from when buying a small SUV. But at the top of the class of models, excluding hybrids, is the Nissan Rogue. Equipped with a standard turbocharged three-cylinder engine, the Rogue gets up to an EPA-estimated 33 mpg in combined driving. That engine is small and efficient but mighty, supplying 201 horsepower and plenty of torque. In addition, the Rogue provides up to 36.5 cubic feet of cargo space behind the back seat. \n2024 Nissan Rogue starting price: $30,240\n\nMidsize SUV: Subaru Outback\n\nAlmost three decades ago, Subaru introduced the Outback. Among midsize SUVs with five-passenger seating, the latest Outback rules the roost, getting up to an EPA-estimated 28 mpg in combined driving with its standard all-wheel-drive system. If the thrifty 182-horsepower four-cylinder engine isn\\'t powerful enough for you, you can get a turbocharged Outback, but it won\\'t be as efficient or affordable. Outbacks offer 32.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the back seat. \n2025 Subaru Outback starting price: $30,290\n\nMidsize Three-Row SUV: Kia Sorento\n\nWhen you need a third-row seat, a midsize SUV can deliver the extra passenger capacity you seek without the price premium of a full-size model. The Kia Sorento is the most fuel-efficient member of the three-row midsizers club, getting up to an EPA-estimated 26 mpg in combined driving from a 191-horsepower four-cylinder engine. A turbocharged powerplant is available, but it costs more to buy and fuel. Behind its second-row seat, the Sorento provides a minimum of 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space. All-wheel drive is either optional or standard on most Sorento trim levels.\n 2024 Kia Sorento starting price: $33,365\n\nFull-size SUV: Chevrolet Tahoe \n\nIt\\'s a big SUV but some versions of the Chevy Tahoe get up to an impressive 24 mpg in combined driving. You\\'ll need to pay extra for the turbocharged diesel engine to achieve that kind of mileage in this eight-passenger full-size SUV. How much more? Happily, it\\'s an affordable $995 option. In addition to its impressive efficiency, the Duramax engine supplies 277 horsepower — or 305 horsepower for the 2025 Tahoe — and plenty of torque for towing. Behind the Tahoe\\'s second-row seat, you\\'ll find a generous 72.6 cubic feet of cargo space. Four-wheel drive is available for every Tahoe trim level.\n2024 Chevrolet Tahoe starting price: $59,190, including the diesel engine upgrade\nEDMUNDS SAYS \nAre there more efficient SUVs than these? Yes, but you\\'ll need a hybrid or plug-in hybrid to beat the five models above. Among the gas-fueled (and diesel) models available for the 2024 model year, these are the best SUVs to save you money at the pump. \n____________\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nChristian Wardlaw is a contributor at Edmunds. \n
"NEW YORK (AP) — Attire, travel, food, liquor, flowers: There\'s no end to expenses when it comes to traditional weddings.\nThrough time, though certainly not always, it was the bride\'s parents who were expected to pay the bulk of expenses, but like so many aspects of weddings, the etiquette has gotten more fluid. The ages of first-time bridal couples is going up. Parents might be older too, and thinking about saving for retirement or already on fixed incomes. \nSo who pays and how much?\nNow, \it\\'s really a candid conversation\"" between the couple and those who might want to contribute, said Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute and co-host of the \""Awesome Etiquette\"" podcast. \n\""Often it\\'s parents, but that\\'s not the case for everybody,\"" she said. \""Never assume that anyone else is going to contribute to your wedding.\""\nJove Meyer, a wedding planner and designer in New York, agreed.\n\""We have found over the years that it\\'s definitely shifted,\"" he said. \""It\'s hard to talk about money, but it\'s one of the most important questions couples have to ask.\""\nAmong U.S. users of the wedding planning site The Knot, parents on average contribute slightly more than half the wedding budget, with bridal couples covering the rest, said editor Sarah Hanlon.\nAge and resources\nThe ages of first-time couples have steadily risen for both men and women since 1998. The median age for men getting married for the first time was 30.2 last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It was 28.4 for women. In 1947, the medians were 23.7 for men and 20.5 for women. \n\""As couples marry later in life and are often more financially established, many choose to cover the majority of expenses, or even the entire wedding, themselves, sometimes accepting contributions from their families as a gesture of support rather than obligation,\"" said Myka Meier of Beaumont Etiquette in New York.\nIn other cases, parents might have saved over the years with a wedding fund.\nWhat does a wedding cost?\nThe average combined cost of a non-destination wedding ceremony and reception last year among U.S. users of The Knot was $35,000. That was up by about $5,000 from 2022, likely due to inflation and the overall economic landscape. The average cost of a destination wedding and reception was $41,000. First marriages tend to be more expensive than second marriages.\nMeyer said weddings can cost far more in places like New York City, where he sees costs as high as $100,000 plus.\nMany young people look to Pinterest, Instagram and TikTok for wedding ideas, he said. The issue: Posters put up lovely photos with no price tags.\n\""I think a lot of couples today, not to their own fault, have no idea what a wedding costs,\"" he said.\nWho used to pay what\n\nEtiquette on ponying up was clearer in the past.\nThe list for the bride\\'s side was long: the engagement party, wedding planner, invitations, photography, videography, venue, bride\\'s attire, floral arrangements, decor, wedding cake, most reception expenses and more.\nAmong a groom\\'s responsibilities: The marriage license and officiant fee, corsages and boutonnières for family members on both sides, rehearsal dinner costs and, sometimes, alcohol for the reception.\nAll of those costs are now an open question for many couples for a number of reasons.\nGay weddings\nMany of the couples that Meyer sees paying for weddings themselves are same-sex couples, and couples who face a lot of unwanted strings attached to money offered by parents.\n\""The people who are paying are those with the resources and/or those with the most requests. Money is power. With same-sex couples, more and more they\\'re paying for it themselves. That\\'s the largest number for sure,\"" he said.\nAdded Hanlon, of The Knot: \""Now more than ever, couples are tossing out traditional wedding etiquette rules, especially those that are gendered or based on heteronormative relationships.\""\nCultural considerations\nMeier, the etiquette expert, noted that religious and cultural norms often dictate which family pays for the wedding, and how much they spend.\nIf steadfast etiquette isn\'t in place, Nick Leighton of the etiquette podcast \""Were You Raised by Wolves?\"" said it\'s increasingly common for expenses to be shared among both families and the couple.\n\""Each party contributes what they wish,\"" he said. \""That often means that each party will contribute a different amount, which is perfectly reasonable.\""\nOpting to spend the money on something else\nWith bridal couples getting older, wedding costs often collide with other pricey desires, like buying a home. \nAnd parents who have saved up to make their children\'s wedding dreams come true are more often leaving it up to offspring to decide what to spend those nest eggs on.\nAt 55, Tammy Mickle in Holland Patent, New York, is a semi-retired school teacher, working three days a week come fall. Her husband retired several years ago. Their only child, a 24-year-old daughter, is a school social worker living at home while she saves money. She and her boyfriend of about two years recently broke up.\nThe Mickles have been socking away money every week for their daughter\'s wedding, amassing about $60,000. That\'s $5,000 less than their daughter makes in a year.\n\""She\'s been looking at houses recently and just the other night said, Mom, do you think instead of using that money for my wedding, could I use it for a house now?

"MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Dressed in protective clothing and armed with a smoker, Peter Nyongesa walked through the mangroves to monitor his beehives along the Indian Ocean coastline.\nThe 69-year-old Nyongesa recalled how he would plead unsuccessfully with loggers to spare the mangroves or cut only the mature ones while leaving the younger ones intact.\n\But they would retort that the trees do not belong to anyone but God,\"" he said.\nSo he has turned to deterring the loggers with bees, hidden in the mangroves and ready to sting.\nTheir hives now dot a section of coastline in Kenya\'s main port city of Mombasa in an effort to deter people who chop mangroves for firewood or home construction. It\'s part of a local conservation initiative.\n\""When people realize that something is beneficial to them, they do not consider the harm that comes with it,\"" Nyongesa said of the loggers.\nMangroves, which thrive in salty water, help in preventing erosion and absorbing the impact of severe weather events such as cyclones.\nBut more than half of the world\\'s mangrove ecosystems are at risk of collapse, according to the first global mangrove assessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems released in May.\nMangroves are threatened by illegal logging, climate change and rising seas, pollution and urban development. According to a Kenya environment ministry report in 2018, about 40% of mangroves along the Indian Ocean coast are degraded.\nIn Mombasa county, it\\'s estimated that almost 50% of the total mangrove area there — 1,850 hectares (4,570 acres) — is degraded.\nSuch overall degradation has slowed in Kenya, which in 2017 developed a 10-year plan to have community conservation efforts manage mangroves. But the efforts have been incomplete because of inadequate resources.\nCommunities are doing what they can. James Kairo, a research scientist at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, said initiatives such as beekeeping are helping. Their honey also brings in community income.\n\""Mangrove honey is also classified as top quality and medicinal,\"" he added. \""This could be due to the environment that mangroves thrives in\"" and what they absorb from their surroundings.\nNyongesa now has 11 beehives and harvests about 8 liters (2 gallons) of honey per hive every three months. Each liter earns him $6, a valuable source of income.\nWhen Nyongesa started beekeeping 25 years ago, he didn\'t know anything about the threat to mangroves or how his bees could help.\nHe became involved in 2019, when he joined a local conservation group called Tulinde Mikoko, Swahili for Let\\'s Protect Mangroves. The group adopted his beekeeping as a community initiative along with mangrove planting. Members also serve as custodians of the mangroves and try to stop loggers.\nThe group has concealed beehives in the top branches of mangroves as silent guardians. The bees are meant to attack unsuspecting loggers.\n\""We positioned them at the peak where they can\\'t be spotted with ease,\"" said Bibiana Nanjilula, the Tulinde Mikoko founder. \""As such, when the loggers start cutting down whichever tree, the bees will attack due to the noise.\""\nThe group hopes the tactic is working but has found it hard to measure its effects in the relatively difficult to access areas.\nThe bees also play a crucial role as pollinators. As they forage among the mangrove flowers, they transfer pollen from one flower to another, facilitating plants\' reproduction.\n\""The healthier the mangroves are, probably the more productive the honey production will be,\"" said Jared Bosire, project manager for the UNEP-Nairobi Convention, who said they encourage the integration of livelihoods with conservation. The office is a project of the United Nations Environment Program, based in Nairobi.\nKenya has 54,430 hectares (134,500 acres) of mangroves remaining, and they contribute $85 million per year to the national economy, according to a report by the Global Mangrove Alliance in 2022.\n___\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n___\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

"When you\'re expecting a baby, you hope nothing goes wrong. But at least one in 20 people who are pregnant develop a scary complication called preeclampsia, a high blood pressure disorder that kills 70,000 women and 500,000 babies worldwide every year.\nThere was no way to know when it might strike — until now. New blood tests may help doctors predict and manage this dangerous condition.\n\When something bad happens in pregnancy, you want to catch it early so you can avoid adverse outcomes for the mom and the baby,\"" said Dr. S. Ananth Karumanchi with Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\nWhat is preeclampsia?\nThe condition affects both the mother and baby and can occur in the second half of pregnancy or the postpartum period. The exact causes aren\\'t known.\nBesides high blood pressure, other signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, changes in vision, nausea and sudden swelling in your face and hands. It\\'s generally diagnosed by checking for protein in the urine, measuring blood pressure and following up with other tests if warranted.\nOnce you have preeclampsia, it can progress rapidly and cause organ damage, stroke, preterm birth, slow growth in the baby and other problems.\nTo prevent the condition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pregnant patients get low-dose aspirin if they have one or more particular risk factors, such as chronic high blood pressure, Type 1 or 2 diabetes before pregnancy or kidney disease. \nThe primary treatment for preeclampsia is to deliver the baby or manage the condition until the baby can be delivered. People with severe preeclampsia are usually hospitalized and may be given medicines to lower blood pressure, prevent seizures and help the fetus\\' lungs develop.\nHow do the new tests work?\nThe tests measure \""biomarkers\"" for preeclampsia in the blood, objective measures that show what\\'s happening in an organism at any given moment.\nAt this point, there are only a few tests on the market.\nOne, by Labcorp, is designed to be performed between 11 and 14 weeks gestation on any pregnant patient. It measures four early pregnancy biomarkers that, combined with other factors, help determine the risk of developing preeclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy.\nTwo other tests — another by Labcorp and one from Thermo Fisher Scientific — are used in the second and third trimesters on hospitalized patients to assess whether they are at risk of progressing to severe preeclampsia within a couple of weeks. More tests by other companies are in the pipeline.\n\""They absolutely represent an exciting advancement, especially when you look at the field of preeclampsia and the fact that there\\'s been very little new introduced to the field in decades,\"" said Eleni Tsigas, CEO of the nonprofit Preeclampsia Foundation. She lost one baby and also nearly died because of undiagnosed preeclampsia about two decades ago, and developed it again in her second pregnancy and gave birth to a son who spent time in neonatal intensive care.\nThe new blood tests augment but don\\'t replace a doctor\\'s judgment, she added, \""basically giving them insight that they haven\\'t had before. And that\\'s particularly useful in cases where things are in the gray zone,\"" such as when you have preexisting health problems such as chronic high blood pressure or obesity.\nShould you ask for a test? \n\""If I were pregnant today then I absolutely would,\"" Tsigas said.\nThough \""there\\'s no therapy right at the moment,\"" Karumanchi said, doctors can closely watch those at higher risk and do more follow-ups with them. For patients shown to be at low risk, the tests offer reassurance.\nThe tests could also help speed up the development of new treatments, he said, because researchers can identify patients at risk who might be willing to join studies.\nStill, some OB-GYNs may not offer the tests immediately because they are so new, Tsigas said. But she figures: Why wait?\n\""You just have to look at the mortality and morbidity rates related to preeclampsia to know that clearly we have work to do,\"" she said. \""So I don\\'t think there\\'s a downside to adding tools to a nearly empty toolbox.\""\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Science and Educational Media Group.

"After advancing further than ever in World Cup qualifying, the Palestinian soccer team is determined to host a game for a change.\nThe football association has proposed playing games in the third stage of its Asian qualification campaign in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and already has support from a number of its opponents, starting against Jordan on Sept. 10.\nThe Palestinian team progressed through the second round of continental qualifying for the first time in its history in June but, because of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, staged its \home\"" games in nearby Kuwait and Qatar.\n\""Playing at a neutral venue isn\\'t permanent and was never meant to be so,\"" Susan Shabali, the PFA\\'s deputy president, told The Associated Press. \""Faisal Al-Husseini is ready to host.\""\nThe 12,500-capacity Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium is situated in the West Bank town of Al Ram.

The war has caused vast destruction across the territory, displaced most of Gaza\'s population of 2.3 million — often multiple times — caused widespread hunger and raised fears of famine.\nThe Palestinian team\'s success has been remarkable during the war and the fact it has played dozens of games on the road since 2019, and the players have had to move for safety and seek overseas contracts.\nWhile there is little soccer currently being played in the territory, most players in the Palestinian roster belong to clubs in foreign leagues. The most recent roster saw coach Makram Daboub select players based in countries including Sweden, Belgium, Libya, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan.\nMohammed Rashid, who plays club soccer for Bali United in Indonesia, told reporters in Perth last month ahead of the second-round finale against Australia that the hardest part of competing in international competition was not being able to play at home.\nOn June 27, the Palestinian team, currently ranked No. 95 in the world, was drawn in Group B of the third round which contains South Korea, Iraq, Jordan, Oman and Kuwait. \nThe top two from each of the three groups of six qualify automatically for the 2026 World Cup.\nAfter the opening game in South Korea on Sept. 5, the Palestinians return to West Asia to take on Jordan five days later.\nThe Jordan Football Association issued a statement this week to \""affirm its position in support of the Palestinian Football Association\\'s right to hold its home matches on its land and among its fans.\""\n\""Jordan is proud to be the first team to face our Palestinian brothers in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers on Palestinian territory,\"" the statement said.\nThe Oman Football Association also said it supported the PFA\\'s \""legitimate right to hold official national team matches in front of its fans on home soil.\"" Kuwait earlier issued its support.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n"""
"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Reem Abu Hayyah, just three months old, was the only member of her family to survive an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip late Monday. A few miles (kilometers) to the north, Mohamed Abuel-Qomasan lost his wife and their twin babies — just four days old — in another strike.\nMore than 10 months into its war with Hamas, Israel\'s relentless bombardment of the isolated territory has wiped out extended families. It has left parents without children and children without parents or siblings. \nAnd some of the sole survivors are so young they will have no memory of those they lost.\nThe Israeli strike late Monday destroyed a home near the southern city of Khan Younis, killing 10 people. The dead included Abu Hayyah\'s parents and five siblings, ranging in age from 5 to 12, as well as the parents of three other children. All four children were wounded in the strike.\n\There is no one left except this baby,\"" said her aunt, Soad Abu Hayyah. \""Since this morning, we have been trying to feed her formula, but she does not accept it, because she is used to her mother\\'s milk.\""\nThe strike that killed Abuel-Qomasan\'s wife and newborns — a boy, Asser, and a girl, Ayssel — also killed the twins\' maternal grandmother. As he sat in a hospital, stunned into near-silence by the loss, he held up the twins\' birth certificates.\nHis wife, Joumana Arafa, a pharmacist, had given birth by cesarean section four days ago and announced the twins\' arrival on Facebook. On Tuesday, he had gone to register the births at a local government office. While he was there, neighbors called to say the home where he was sheltering, near the central city of Deir al-Balah, had been bombed.\n\""I don\\'t know what happened,\"" he said. \""I am told it was a shell that hit the house.\""\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the strikes.\nThe Health Ministry in Gaza said 115 newborns have been killed in the territory since the war began.\nThe military says it tries to avoid harming Palestinian civilians, and blames their deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in dense residential areas, sometimes sheltering in and launching attacks from homes, schools, mosques and other civilian buildings.\nBut the army rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. Gaza\'s Health Ministry says nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, without saying how many were fighters.\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 in the Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel that ignited the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has often said that \""they killed parents in front of their children and children in front of their parents\"" to illustrate the brutality of the attack, most recently in his July address to the United States Congress.\nIsrael\'s offensive has left thousands of orphans — so many that local doctors employ an acronym when registering them: WCNSF, or \""wounded child, no surviving family.\"" The United Nations estimated in February that some 17,000 children in Gaza are now unaccompanied, and the number is likely to have grown since.\nThe Abu Hayyah family was sheltering in an area that Israel had ordered people to evacuate in recent days. It was one of several such orders that have led hundreds of thousands to seek shelter in an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone consisting of squalid, crowded tent camps along the coast.\nThe vast majority of Gaza\'s population has fled their homes, often multiple times. The coastal strip, which is just 25 miles (40 kilometers) long by about 7 miles (11 kilometers) wide, has been completely sealed off by Israeli forces since May.\nAround 84% of Gaza\'s territory has been placed under evacuation orders by the Israeli military, according to the United Nations.\nMany families have ignored the evacuation orders because they say nowhere feels safe, or because they are unable to make the arduous journey on foot, or because they fear they will never be able to return to their homes, even after the war.\nAbuel-Qomasan and his wife had heeded orders to evacuate Gaza City in the opening weeks of the war. They sought shelter in central Gaza, as the army had instructed.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n___\nFollow AP\\'s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n"""
"KANYARUCHINYA, Congo (AP) — Children sit on the dirt, their clothes ragged and torn, their shoes punctured with holes, but their eyes bright and fixed on what\'s playing out in front of them.\nIn a corner of a refugee camp in conflict-wracked eastern Congo, about a dozen chess games are going, each one with its own fascinated audience.\nThe Soga Chess Club for children doesn\'t have enough tables and chairs. The \boards\"" are squares of paper with green and white blocks marked on them and are lined with plastic to protect them from the wear and tear coming their way. Irritatingly, the pieces sometimes topple over if players haven\'t found a flat enough stretch of ground to lay their game out on.\nBut the chess club founders say it\\'s good enough to try and take these kids\' minds away from what they\\'ve seen and experienced so far: fighting and killing, hunger and fear. They\'ve all lost their homes. Some have lost fathers, mothers or siblings in one of the world\'s worst humanitarian crises.\nChess is \""a therapeutic escape from the stress and horrors these children have endured,\"" said Gabriel Nzaji, one of the club\'s instructors. He said the game encourages the children to be quiet and to focus, a way of calming their minds.\nMore than 5 million people have been displaced by decades of conflict in eastern Congo, where dozens of armed groups fight each other over land and control of areas rich in sought-after minerals. An increase in fighting in recent months has led to a new surge of refugees, and there\'s no end in sight for a displacement disaster that dwarfs many others that get more global attention.\nHundreds of thousands of people forced to escape the attacks that destroy their towns and villages have ended up in vast displacement camps like Kanyaruchinya, where the Soga Chess Club operates. The United Nations Children\'s Fund says around a quarter million children live in the camps, ripped away from their homes and their schools, and sometimes their families.\nSoga has around 100 children signed up to its club. One of them is 9-year-old Heritier, who is still learning the game, but confident enough already to hand out his own lesson.\n\""Here,\"" he said, his fingers flicking across the board. \""I\\'m doing everything to protect my king on the chessboard. I have to sacrifice this queen. You see that?\""\n\""I like this game,\"" Heritier said. \""It relaxes me.\""\nThe trauma suffered by children in eastern Congo is incalculable as aid agencies battle to provide food and shelter to as many of the millions that have been displaced as possible. Some of the children in the chess club have been living in the Kanyaruchinya camp for almost two years, their lives in limbo.\nBut in Heritier\'s grin and his newfound delight in a game — a given for so many kids — the club organizers see a sign of hope.\n\""The perspective of these children has changed drastically,\"" said Nzaji. \""(They) approach life with a different mindset.\""\nThe organizers said they noticed that most of the children would spend their days engaged in rough, war-like games, sometimes involving sticks they\'d swing at each other. They hope chess offers them something other than a mimicking of the conflict they\'ve grown up around.\nAkili Bashige, president of the Soga Chess Club, said parts of the camp have been transformed into sites of optimism by children playing chess. \""Despite their limited resources, their passion persists,\"" he said of his club\'s recruits.\nSoga has also taken the game to orphanages in the region, and Bashige said he wants to start clubs for children who live on the streets in nearby towns.\nThe club can also be uplifting to parents, who worry for their children and their future — which they see slipping away. \nArusi, a 13-year-old girl, recently won a tournament and with it a reputation for being a fierce competitor. Her mother beamed with pride as she recalled the feat.\n\""Before Soga chess, they were idle because of the war and a lack of schooling,\"" said Feza Twambaze, Arusi\\'s mom. \""Seeing them engaged and thriving fills me with immense joy.\""\n___\nFor more news on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n___\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Even before he was on the shortlist for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was working to portray Donald Trump and Republicans to the American public as \just weird.\"" \n\""These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,\"" Walz said in a TV interview last month. \nThe message started with news interviews and eventually spread like wildfire across social media with the help of young Americans. The simple terminology of labeling the other side as \""weird\"" or \""odd\"" is not revolutionary or sophisticated in American politics but represents a new framing for Democrats who have spent the last eight years trying to defeat Trump and Trumpism by personifying him as the greatest threat to democracy. \nWalz went back to the reference at his first rally Tuesday with Vice President Kamala Harris, saying of Republicans: \""These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell.\""\n\""The opposite of normalizing authoritarianism is to make it weird, to call it out and to sort of mock it,\"" Jennifer Mercieca, a historian at Texas A&M University, who wrote a book on Trump\\'s rhetoric, said. \""To say, ‘Hey, that\\'s a weird thing you\\'re doing, calling your opposition enemies instead of saying that they\\'re good people who have different policy preferences.\'\"" \nNow the party is turning the page with a new generation of candidates trying to appeal not just to Americans\' fears about what a second Trump presidency would mean, but to plainly label the policies and actions of the Republican party as abnormal. And Democrats see no more effective messenger to deliver this new attack than Walz, the 60-year-old Midwestern dad, who on Tuesday was chosen to become their vice presidential nominee. \n\""Gov. Walz can do the job, and helps reinforce that we\\'re team normal,\"" freshman Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio said in a statement Tuesday. \""We\\'re pragmatic, reliable and bipartisan.\""\nWalz\'s ability to speak in layman\\'s terms about policy and politics coupled with his knowledge of the internet zeitgeist has helped propel the little-known politician to the national stage and on the \""For You\"" social media pages of millions of Gen Z voters whose support will be crucial for Democrats come November. \nLabeled \""the cool dad\"" online, news that Walz would be the Democratic running mate ignited a stream of online memes, including one with the caption, \""To the window to the Walz,\"" a reference to the hit 2003 rap song \""Get Low\"" by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz. On TikTok, users created 60-second montages of Walz talking about the phenomenon of the new Charli XCX album Brat, which he says his young daughter helped explain to him, mixed with footage of him lambasting GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance for his comments on \""childless cat ladies.\"" \n\""Go ahead and continue to denigrate people. Go ahead. My God, they went after cat people. Good luck with that,\"" Walz says in a MSNBC clip that has more than 150,000 likes on TikTok. \""Turn on the internet. See what cat people do when you go after them.\""\nBut the same qualities that led Walz to the Democratic ticket are already being used against him by Republicans who have just in the last few hours labeled him as \""weird\"" and \""radical.\"" \nTrump sent a fundraising email Tuesday calling Walz \""Dangerously Liberal\"" and saying he would \""unleash HELL ON EARTH.\""\nBut Walz\'s legislative record on issues like protecting abortion rights, legalizing recreational marijuana and restricting gun access have helped him gain popularity with young voters beyond his own solidly blue state to communities across the country. \nVoters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z-led organization that represents young political activists and voters, threw its full support behind Walz after weeks of campaigning on his behalf, saying that he has \""dedicated his life to educating and empowering young people as a teacher and public servant.\""\n\""Governor Walz gets bonus points for articulating exactly how young Americans feel about Donald Trump and JD Vance: They are weird,\"" Santiago Mayer, the group\'s executive director, said in a statement. \""Trump and Vance are weirdly fixated on taking away freedoms from Americans and weirdly obsessed with culture wars.\""\n"""
"BERLIN (AP) — A human rights activist since the 1980s, Oleg Orlov thought Russia had turned a corner when the Soviet Union collapsed and a democratically elected president became leader.\nBut then Vladimir Putin rose to power, crushing dissent and launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finally, the 71-year-old Orlov was himself thrown in prison for opposing the war. Freed last week in the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War, he was forced into exile — just like the Soviet dissidents of his youth.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday in Berlin, Orlov decried the scale and severity of repressions under Putin, with people imprisoned for merely criticizing the authorities, something unseen since the days of dictator Josef Stalin.\nAnd he\'s vowing to continue his work to free the many political prisoners in Russia and keep their names in the spotlight.\n\We\\'re sliding somewhere into Stalin times,\"" said Orlov, who at times showed signs of fatigue from a hectic schedule of media interviews in the week since his release.\nHe was sentenced to 2½ years in prison in February for writing an anti-war article. When he was unexpectedly moved last month from a jail in central Russia for what eventually led to the Aug. 1 prisoner swap, he was waiting to be transferred to a penal colony after losing an appeal.\nThe move came as a complete surprise, he told AP.\nFirst, he was told to write a request for clemency addressed to Putin — something he said he flatly refused. Days later, he was put in a van and driven, to his astonishment, to an airport in Samara and flown to Moscow.\n\""To find yourself on a plane, among free people, straight from a prison — a very weird feeling,\"" Orlov said.\nThree more days followed in Moscow\\'s notorious Lefortovo Prison, isolated in his cell, where he wrote a complaint that he was denied access to his lawyer. Then, he was shown a document saying he had been pardoned. He was put on a plane again, this time out of Russia, with other freed dissidents, and was greeted in Germany by Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nHe broke into a smile when he recalled seeing familiar faces on the bus to the airport — artist and musician Sasha Skochilenko, imprisoned for a small anti-war protest, opposition politician Andrei Pivovarov, and others.\n\""So when a state security operative was announcing (on the bus) that it was a swap, we already understood it perfectly well,\"" he said.\nWhile held at Lefortovo, however, Orlov suspected another criminal case was being prepared against him. As for what charges the authorities could file, he said, \""They would find (one) without a problem.\""\n\""The repressive machine … has been put in motion and it runs on its own,\"" the veteran human rights advocate said. \""The machine works to sustain itself and can only intensify the repressions, make them harsher.\""\nMemorial, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning rights group Orlov co-founded, says more than 760 political prisoners remain jailed in Russia. Another prominent rights group, OVD-Info, says over 1,300 are currently imprisoned in politically motivated cases.\nSome of them face isolation, without access to lawyers or doctors, often on orders from authorities, Orlov said.\nOpposition politicians, such as the late Alexei Navalny or the recently swapped Vladimir Kara-Murza, were held in such isolated conditions in remote penal colonies, and their health deteriorated.\n\""My experience was much easier than that of many others,\"" Orlov said. Prison officials \""never exercised complete lawlessness toward me,\"" he added, \""I wasn\\'t singled out from the crowd.\""\nStill, it\'s important to support the growing number of those prosecuted on political grounds, he said, from keeping their plight in the headlines to sending them letters, and care packages, and helping their families.\nIn prison, \""there is always this feeling of concern for your family. If you know that your family is going to be all right, it really helps to feel peace. And in prison it is the most important thing — not to despair and feel peace of mind,\"" Orlov said.\nIn the harried days since beginning his new life in exile that he never sought, Orlov has had little time to process his newfound freedom, and he is yet to reunite with his wife.\nBut he is determined to carry on his work with Memorial, and he says there are things advocates can still do from outside Russia, such as maintaining the database of political prisoners and coordinating assistance to those behind bars\nStopping the repressions altogether, however, will only take place when Putin\\'s \""repressive, terrorist regime\"" ceases to exist, he says. \n"""
