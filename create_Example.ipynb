       "'NEW YORK (AP) — Victoria Cornejo Barrera thought the legal helpline for workers sounded too good to be true. \\\\nA month earlier, Cornejo Barrera had been forced to take leave from her job as head custodian at a South Carolina high school after she turned in a doctor\\\\\\'s note asking to be exempt from tasks like climbing ladders and lifting more than 20 pounds because she was pregnant. \\\\nShe spent a month crying and blaming herself for thinking she could keep her job while pregnant. She used up all her accumulated paid time off because she couldn\\\\\\'t afford to go without a paycheck. Then she got a notice from human resources saying she would have to start paying $600 a month to stay on health insurance while on unpaid leave.\\\\n\\\\I was feeling so guilty. I was feeling like my pregnancy was the problem,\\\\\" Cornejo Barrera said. \\\\nSearching for help online, she came across the website run by the legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, explaining about a federal law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that entitled her to the types of accommodations she had been seeking. It had gone into effect in June 2023, a month before she was pushed out of her job.\\\\nWas the law really on her side? Cornejo Barrera called the helpline.\\\\nA new law\\\\\\'s complicated first year \\\\nNearly 500 workers in similar circumstances have contacted the helpline in the year since the implementation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which strengthens the rights of workers to seek accommodations for pregnancy-related needs. The experiences of those workers tell a complicated story about the impact of a new law that is still unfamiliar to many employers, according to a report released Tuesday by A Better Balance, the organization that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for the law, which Congress finally passed in December 2022. \\\\nMost of those workers swiftly obtained accommodation after learning about their rights and invoking them with their employers, said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance. But many women confronted employers who didn\\\\\\'t know about the law, misunderstood its scope or simply refused to comply, according to the report.\\\\nA bitter legal battle over whether the law covers abortion is further complicating its enforcement. \\\\nThe dispute centers on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations that took effect Tuesday detailing how employers should comply with the law, and which included abortion among the pregnancy-related conditions that entitle workers to time off and other accommodations.\\\\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily prohibited the EEOC from enforcing the abortion provision of its rules against employers located in Louisiana and Mississippi, or against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and three other religious groups that filed a consolidated lawsuit against the EEOC, arguing that the abortion provision is an illegal interpretation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\\\\nAnother judge in Arkansas last week dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general from 17 states, but Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is leading the case, said he is considering legal options to continue pursuing the challenge. \\\\nThat lawsuit had asked the judge to suspend the EEOC rules in their entirety, a prospect that the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center, along with more than 20 labor and women\\\\\\\\\\'s advocacy groups, warned in amicus briefs could thwart the successful implementation of law. The EEOC\\\\\\'s rules, for example, make clear that employers cannot delay requests by asking pregnant workers for onerous paperwork to back claims of common pregnancy-related limitations such as morning sickness or back pain. \\\\nAlthough the pregnant workers law would remain in place even without the EEOC rules, advocates say it\\\\\\'s a badly needed tool for settling disputes and training employers on compliance. According to A Better Balance, one out of seven workers who contacted its helpline since the law took effect said their employers had ordered them to take leave rather than grant them reasonable accommodations. \\\\nCornejo Barrera was among them, but her employer reversed the decision after she sent her human resources department a letter invoking her rights. Within two days, she shared language from the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act with her supervisor, who then told her she could return to work immediately. \\\\nRaquel Robinson, a telecommunication specialist in Ohio, also ultimately prevailed in a similar confrontation with her company. After her daughter was born in October 2022, Robinson was diagnosed with postpartum depression.\\\\n\\\\\"Mentally, I just was not in a good place where I felt like I was good enough to be my daughter\\\\\\\\\\'s mom,\\\\\" she said. \\\\nAfter Robinson\\\\\\'s disability leave ended in July 2023, her therapist told her she was entitled to work from home under the new law. But her company resisted her request for more than a month. \\\\nRobinson reached out to A Better Balance for help and the company relented. \\\\nOther workers are still fighting to be protected under the law. The EEOC says it has received 1,869 charges so far citing violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and has resolved more than 450, though it has not provided details on the cases.\\\\nThe abortion issue complicates the law\\\\nThe law\\\\\\'s passage in 2022 came after years of campaigning by advocacy groups and women in low-wage jobs who shared stories of being denied even basic accommodations. But Republican lawmakers and conservative religious leaders who had overwhelmingly supported the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act were furious when the EEOC rules explicitly included abortion. \\\\nCiting numerous court rulings, the EEOC in its regulations said it was conforming to decades of legal precedent establishing that pregnancy-related discrimination laws include abortion.\\\\nMylissa Farmer, the woman at the center of a federal investigation of two hospitals who refused to provide her with an emergency abortion, said her ordeal shows why the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act must include abortion. \\\\nFarmer sought emergency treatment after her water broke early at 17 weeks of pregnancy in August 2022. Doctors at hospitals in Missouri and Kansas told Farmer her fetus would not survive, that her amniotic fluid had emptied and that she was at risk for serious infection or losing her uterus but they refused to provide an abortion. She and her husband traveled for hours while she was in labor before a clinic in Illinois provided her with an abortion. \\\\nFarmer, who was working a low-wage job as a sales representative, said her supervisor repeatedly contacted her during her ordeal to pressure her to return to work. She said her doctor recommended she take two weeks off to recover but she returned to work after two days because she was afraid of getting fired. But she ended up facing discipline after absences to cope with the physical and mental trauma of losing her pregnancy.\\\\n\\\\\"I was just not able to get the care that I needed at the time and it made it really difficult to even deal with the emotional loss of what we were going through,\\\\\" said Farmer, who is being represented by the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center in a complaint to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \\\\n___\\\\nThe Associated Press\\\\\\\\\\' women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

They curl hair, do makeup, and adjust bow ties.\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s all for the hospital\\\\\\'s annual \\\\\"Mis XV\\\\\" or \\\\\"My Fifteenth\\\\\" event. Whether the young patients are in treatment for a serious disease or have overcome cancer, the hospital celebrates the coming-of-age of these teenagers. After going through expensive treatments, some families can\\\\\\'t afford to pay for a party — with the hospital providing them an alternative.\\\\n\\\\\"We\\\\\\'ve really just bought shoes because the hospital handles everything,\\\\\" said Díaz. \\\\nThe hospital started throwing the event in 2017 after volunteer nurses caught wind that a beloved patient would turn 15 soon. They took it as an opportunity to organize a celebration for her and eventually turned it into an annual hospital event that\\\\\\'s been going strong for seven years.\\\\nIn Mexico, the \\\\\"quinceñera\\\\\" or \\\\\"fifteenth birthday\\\\\" is a huge rite of passage for adolescents, particularly girls. The occasion marks the transition of a teen into adulthood.\\\\nThough Alexa\\\\\\'s birthday was last month, the hospital allows patients to participate if their birthdays happen within the year of the celebration. \\\\nShe has been a patient at the hospital the past three years receiving treatment for lupus.

His mother said he gets tired often, but is still motivated to make the most out of every day.\\\\n\\\\\"Like every other teenager, my favorite class is physical education,\\\\\" Carlos says. \\\\\"I also really enjoy doing math — I have so much fun doing different operations.\\\\\"\\\\nThe preparations for the hospital\\\\\\'s extravaganza have been a long time in the making. As early as January the hospital is already reaching out to make-up artists and other vendors to see if they want to participate.

There\\\\\\'s going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\\\\\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \\\\\"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\\\\\"\\\\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\\\\n\\\\\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\\\\\" Silver said. \\\\\"But it\\\\\\\\\\'s very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent… It\\\\\\\\\\'s a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)\\\\\\\\\\'s or IRA\\\\\\\\\\'s or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\\\\\"\\\\nSilver urged investors to remember that \\\\\"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\\\\\" and that \\\\\"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\\\\\"\\\\nWhat to do if you\\\\\\'re a young or new investor\\\\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\\\\n\\\\\"You\\\\\\'re reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\\\\\"\\\\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down. \\\\nWhat to do if you\\\\\\'re near retirement\\\\n\\\\\"Whenever you invest in stocks it\\\\\\\\\\'s important to be mindful of your time horizon,\\\\\" said Alev. \\\\\"For instance, do you expect you\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you\\\\\\\\\\'re likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\\\\\"\\\\nSilver agreed.\\\\n\\\\\"I don\\\\\\\\\\'t believe it when people say, ‘Don\\\\\\\\\\'t look at your 401(k),\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\\\\\"\\\\nIf it doesn\\\\\\'t, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\\\\nNationwide\\\\\\'s Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn\\\\\\'t more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\\\\n\\\\\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\\\\\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future. \\\\nWhat to do if you have debt\\\\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it\\\\\\'s important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \\\\\"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\\\\\" Silver said.\\\\n__\\\\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

They have been found in a wide range of body tissues, including the heart, liver, kidneys and even testicles.\\\\nBut are they actually harming you?\\\\nEvidence suggests they might, but it\\\\\\'s limited in scope. Some researchers are worried, but acknowledge there are lots of unanswered questions.\\\\nDr. Marya Zlatnik, a San Francisco-based obstetrician who has studied environmental toxins and pregnancy, has seen studies raising concerns about microplastics\\\\\\' impact on the health of babies and adults. \\\\nBut it\\\\\\'s a young research field, and it\\\\\\'s not something she generally discusses with patients.\\\\n\\\\I\\\\\\'m not entirely sure what to say yet,\\\\\" Zlatnik said.\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s a look at what\\\\\\'s known so far:\\\\nWHAT ARE MICROPLASTICS?\\\\nPlastics are man-made materials — many of them derived from oil or other petroleum products. They can break down into smaller particles, through exposure to heat and weather and even animal digestion. \\\\nResearchers have increasingly been interested in microplastics, which can be as wide as a pencil eraser or as small as a fraction of the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics, another area of study, are even smaller.\\\\nThese minuscule plastics have been detected in air, water and soil, in milk, and in bottled and tap drinking water. They also have been found in a variety of foods, including salt, sugar, honey, rice and seafood. \\\\nARE THERE MICROPLASTICS IN YOU?\\\\nMost likely yes.\\\\nThere is scientific debate about how much people inhale and ingest, and it can vary on what they eat and drink and where they live, researchers say. \\\\nSome Australian researchers, on behalf of the World Wildlife Fund, calculated in 2019 that many people each week consume roughly 5 grams of plastic from common food and beverages — the equivalent of a credit card. That estimate is not universally embraced by researchers, but is commonly mentioned in news articles. \\\\nResearchers are still trying to understand exposure levels, but study after study is finding signs of plastics in body tissues.\\\\n\\\\\"Microplastics have been measured in pretty much all of the body tissues that have been evaluated,\\\\\" said Tracey Woodruff, a University of California at San Francisco researcher. Scientists have even reported finding them in the penis, in ovaries and in placentas.\\\\nWILL MICROPLASTICS HURT YOU?\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s still being sorted out. \\\\nA 2022 World Health Organization report concluded there was no clear risk to human health, based on the available evidence. \\\\nThere\\\\\\\\\\'s also not an obvious signal of widespread public health impact, at least in terms of mortality. Cancer, heart disease and stroke death rates have been falling, not rising. \\\\nBut researchers only started measuring plastics in the human body — and trying to assess the health effects — in recent years. Some of that work is only coming to fruition now.\\\\nIt makes sense that microplastics are harmful because they contain toxic chemicals, said Woodruff, who was part of a team that reviewed nearly 2,000 studies about microplastics at the request of California legislators. It may be, for example, that microplastics play a role in rising occurrences of some cancers in younger people, she said.\\\\nAvailable information indicates plastics can spark inflammation and cause other problematic changes in the body that can, for example, raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \\\\nA small study in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year suggested, but did not prove, that patients with evidence of plastics in their arteries were at greater risk of death from heart attacks and strokes. But an expert not involved in the research suggested the study may have overstated any effects.\\\\n\\\\\"Even though there\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot we still don\\\\\\\\\\'t know about microplastic particles and the harm they cause to humans, the information that is available today is in my mind very concerning,\\\\\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, of Boston College.\\\\nWHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT MICROPLASTICS?\\\\nThere are ways to reduce potential microplastics exposure, researchers say.\\\\nTake your shoes off before you go in the house, to avoid tracking in plastics-laden dust (not to mention germs, dirt and other debris) throughout your home.\\\\nEat foods — especially fresh fruits and vegetables — that you prepare in the home.\\\\nDon\\\\\\\\\\'t microwave a meal in a plastic tray, no matter what TV dinner instructions might say, Woodruff said. \\\\nAnd opt for reusable stainless steel or glass water bottles, rather than disposable plastic ones, she added.\\\\nZlatnik, the obstetrician, noted that families with limited incomes may have bigger things to worry about. \\\\n\\\\\"If someone is worried about where their next meal is going to come from, I\\\\\\'m not going to give them advice to keep their leftovers in glass containers and to not microwave in plastic,\\\\\" she said.\\\\n___\\\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\\\\\\\\\'s Science and Educational Media Group.

The remaining 2% will be set aside for members of ethnic minorities and transgender and disabled people.\\\\nThe government accepted the decision, and restored the internet thinking that the situation would ease.

But many women confronted employers who didn\\\\\\'t know about the law, misunderstood its scope or simply refused to comply, according to the report.\\\\nA bitter legal battle over whether the law covers abortion is further complicating its enforcement. \\\\nThe dispute centers on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations that took effect Tuesday detailing how employers should comply with the law, and which included abortion among the pregnancy-related conditions that entitle workers to time off and other accommodations.\\\\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily prohibited the EEOC from enforcing the abortion provision of its rules against employers located in Louisiana and Mississippi, or against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and three other religious groups that filed a consolidated lawsuit against the EEOC, arguing that the abortion provision is an illegal interpretation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\\\\nAnother judge in Arkansas last week dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general from 17 states, but Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is leading the case, said he is considering legal options to continue pursuing the challenge. \\\\nThat lawsuit had asked the judge to suspend the EEOC rules in their entirety, a prospect that the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center, along with more than 20 labor and women\\\\\\\\\\'s advocacy groups, warned in amicus briefs could thwart the successful implementation of law. The EEOC\\\\\\'s rules, for example, make clear that employers cannot delay requests by asking pregnant workers for onerous paperwork to back claims of common pregnancy-related limitations such as morning sickness or back pain. \\\\nAlthough the pregnant workers law would remain in place even without the EEOC rules, advocates say it\\\\\\'s a badly needed tool for settling disputes and training employers on compliance. According to A Better Balance, one out of seven workers who contacted its helpline since the law took effect said their employers had ordered them to take leave rather than grant them reasonable accommodations. \\\\nCornejo Barrera was among them, but her employer reversed the decision after she sent her human resources department a letter invoking her rights. Within two days, she shared language from the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act with her supervisor, who then told her she could return to work immediately. \\\\nRaquel Robinson, a telecommunication specialist in Ohio, also ultimately prevailed in a similar confrontation with her company. After her daughter was born in October 2022, Robinson was diagnosed with postpartum depression.\\\\n\\\\\"Mentally, I just was not in a good place where I felt like I was good enough to be my daughter\\\\\\\\\\'s mom,\\\\\" she said. \\\\nAfter Robinson\\\\\\'s disability leave ended in July 2023, her therapist told her she was entitled to work from home under the new law. But her company resisted her request for more than a month. \\\\nRobinson reached out to A Better Balance for help and the company relented. \\\\nOther workers are still fighting to be protected under the law. The EEOC says it has received 1,869 charges so far citing violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and has resolved more than 450, though it has not provided details on the cases.\\\\nThe abortion issue complicates the law\\\\nThe law\\\\\\'s passage in 2022 came after years of campaigning by advocacy groups and women in low-wage jobs who shared stories of being denied even basic accommodations. But Republican lawmakers and conservative religious leaders who had overwhelmingly supported the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act were furious when the EEOC rules explicitly included abortion. \\\\nCiting numerous court rulings, the EEOC in its regulations said it was conforming to decades of legal precedent establishing that pregnancy-related discrimination laws include abortion.\\\\nMylissa Farmer, the woman at the center of a federal investigation of two hospitals who refused to provide her with an emergency abortion, said her ordeal shows why the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act must include abortion. \\\\nFarmer sought emergency treatment after her water broke early at 17 weeks of pregnancy in August 2022. Doctors at hospitals in Missouri and Kansas told Farmer her fetus would not survive, that her amniotic fluid had emptied and that she was at risk for serious infection or losing her uterus but they refused to provide an abortion. She and her husband traveled for hours while she was in labor before a clinic in Illinois provided her with an abortion. \\\\nFarmer, who was working a low-wage job as a sales representative, said her supervisor repeatedly contacted her during her ordeal to pressure her to return to work. She said her doctor recommended she take two weeks off to recover but she returned to work after two days because she was afraid of getting fired. But she ended up facing discipline after absences to cope with the physical and mental trauma of losing her pregnancy.\\\\n\\\\\"I was just not able to get the care that I needed at the time and it made it really difficult to even deal with the emotional loss of what we were going through,\\\\\" said Farmer, who is being represented by the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center in a complaint to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \\\\n___\\\\nThe Associated Press\\\\\\\\\\' women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\\\\nWhat to do in general\\\\n\\\\\"It\\\\\\\\\\'s important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There\\\\\\'s going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\\\\\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \\\\\"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\\\\\"\\\\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\\\\n\\\\\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\\\\\" Silver said. \\\\\"But it\\\\\\\\\\'s very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent… It\\\\\\\\\\'s a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)\\\\\\\\\\'s or IRA\\\\\\\\\\'s or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\\\\\"\\\\nSilver urged investors to remember that \\\\\"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\\\\\" and that \\\\\"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\\\\\"\\\\nWhat to do if you\\\\\\'re a young or new investor\\\\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\\\\n\\\\\"You\\\\\\'re reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\\\\\"\\\\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down. \\\\nWhat to do if you\\\\\\'re near retirement\\\\n\\\\\"Whenever you invest in stocks it\\\\\\\\\\'s important to be mindful of your time horizon,\\\\\" said Alev. \\\\\"For instance, do you expect you\\\\\\\\\\'ll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you\\\\\\\\\\'re likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\\\\\"\\\\nSilver agreed.\\\\n\\\\\"I don\\\\\\\\\\'t believe it when people say, ‘Don\\\\\\\\\\'t look at your 401(k),\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\\\\\"\\\\nIf it doesn\\\\\\'t, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\\\\nNationwide\\\\\\'s Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn\\\\\\'t more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\\\\n\\\\\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\\\\\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future. \\\\nWhat to do if you have debt\\\\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it\\\\\\'s important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments.

Some researchers are worried, but acknowledge there are lots of unanswered questions.\\\\nDr. Marya Zlatnik, a San Francisco-based obstetrician who has studied environmental toxins and pregnancy, has seen studies raising concerns about microplastics\\\\\\' impact on the health of babies and adults. \\\\nBut it\\\\\\'s a young research field, and it\\\\\\'s not something she generally discusses with patients.\\\\n\\\\I\\\\\\'m not entirely sure what to say yet,\\\\\" Zlatnik said.\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s a look at what\\\\\\'s known so far:\\\\nWHAT ARE MICROPLASTICS?\\\\nPlastics are man-made materials — many of them derived from oil or other petroleum products. They can break down into smaller particles, through exposure to heat and weather and even animal digestion. \\\\nResearchers have increasingly been interested in microplastics, which can be as wide as a pencil eraser or as small as a fraction of the width of a human hair. Nanoplastics, another area of study, are even smaller.\\\\nThese minuscule plastics have been detected in air, water and soil, in milk, and in bottled and tap drinking water. They also have been found in a variety of foods, including salt, sugar, honey, rice and seafood. \\\\nARE THERE MICROPLASTICS IN YOU?\\\\nMost likely yes.\\\\nThere is scientific debate about how much people inhale and ingest, and it can vary on what they eat and drink and where they live, researchers say. \\\\nSome Australian researchers, on behalf of the World Wildlife Fund, calculated in 2019 that many people each week consume roughly 5 grams of plastic from common food and beverages — the equivalent of a credit card. That estimate is not universally embraced by researchers, but is commonly mentioned in news articles. \\\\nResearchers are still trying to understand exposure levels, but study after study is finding signs of plastics in body tissues.\\\\n\\\\\"Microplastics have been measured in pretty much all of the body tissues that have been evaluated,\\\\\" said Tracey Woodruff, a University of California at San Francisco researcher. Scientists have even reported finding them in the penis, in ovaries and in placentas.\\\\nWILL MICROPLASTICS HURT YOU?\\\\nThat\\\\\\'s still being sorted out. \\\\nA 2022 World Health Organization report concluded there was no clear risk to human health, based on the available evidence. \\\\nThere\\\\\\\\\\'s also not an obvious signal of widespread public health impact, at least in terms of mortality. Cancer, heart disease and stroke death rates have been falling, not rising. \\\\nBut researchers only started measuring plastics in the human body — and trying to assess the health effects — in recent years. Some of that work is only coming to fruition now.\\\\nIt makes sense that microplastics are harmful because they contain toxic chemicals, said Woodruff, who was part of a team that reviewed nearly 2,000 studies about microplastics at the request of California legislators. It may be, for example, that microplastics play a role in rising occurrences of some cancers in younger people, she said.\\\\nAvailable information indicates plastics can spark inflammation and cause other problematic changes in the body that can, for example, raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. \\\\nA small study in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year suggested, but did not prove, that patients with evidence of plastics in their arteries were at greater risk of death from heart attacks and strokes. But an expert not involved in the research suggested the study may have overstated any effects.\\\\n\\\\\"Even though there\\\\\\\\\\'s a lot we still don\\\\\\\\\\'t know about microplastic particles and the harm they cause to humans, the information that is available today is in my mind very concerning,\\\\\" said Dr. Philip Landrigan, of Boston College.\\\\nWHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT MICROPLASTICS?\\\\nThere are ways to reduce potential microplastics exposure, researchers say.\\\\nTake your shoes off before you go in the house, to avoid tracking in plastics-laden dust (not to mention germs, dirt and other debris) throughout your home.\\\\nEat foods — especially fresh fruits and vegetables — that you prepare in the home.\\\\nDon\\\\\\\\\\'t microwave a meal in a plastic tray, no matter what TV dinner instructions might say, Woodruff said. \\\\nAnd opt for reusable stainless steel or glass water bottles, rather than disposable plastic ones, she added.\\\\nZlatnik, the obstetrician, noted that families with limited incomes may have bigger things to worry about. \\\\n\\\\\"If someone is worried about where their next meal is going to come from, I\\\\\\'m not going to give them advice to keep their leftovers in glass containers and to not microwave in plastic,\\\\\" she said.\\\\n___\\\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\\\\\\\\\'s Science and Educational Media Group.

As troops pulled back and internet access was restored, tens of thousands of people began to celebrate in the streets, and thousands stormed the leader\\\\\\'s official residence.\\\\nHere\\\\\\\\\\'s what we know:\\\\nWho will lead the next government?\\\\nShortly after Hasina resigned, the country\\\\\\'s military chief said the army would seek the figurehead president\\\\\\'s guidance to appoint an interim government. \\\\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin announced late Monday after meeting with Gen.

The internet and mobile data were also turned off.\\\\nThe government says nearly 150 people died last month, while local media have reported that more than 200 were killed.\\\\nWhy were they protesting?\\\\nAt first, the demonstrations were against a quota system that set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\\\\\\\\\\'s 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.\\\\nProtesters said the system was discriminatory and benefited supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\\\\\\\\\\'s Awami League party, which led the independence movement.\\\\nThe furor highlighted the extent of economic distress in Bangladesh, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low.

Trump and President Joe Biden each called for unity after the shooting, with the president telling the nation, \\\\\"We can\\\\\\'t allow violence to be normalized.\\\\\"\\\\nIntense partisanship, punctuated by violence, has long been a part of American politics. In 1798, congressmen from opposing parties brawled in the U.S. House chamber, beating each other with a cane and fireplace tongs. Four presidents have been killed by assassins, with other presidents and candidates wounded or targeted. Yet the attack on Trump evoked memories of more recent incidents. \\\\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords was wounded in a 2011 shooting outside an Arizona grocery store. Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, now House majority leader, was shot in 2017 while practicing for a charity baseball game. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan was the target of a foiled kidnapping plot uncovered in 2020.\\\\nEven after the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol shocked the world, political violence continued. \\\\nA man with a hammer bludgeoned the husband of then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, in their San Francisco home in 2022. Last year, a man with a history of mental illness went to the Fairfax, Virginia, district office of Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, looking to kill him with a baseball bat. Connolly wasn\\\\\\\\\\'t there, so the man attacked two staffers.\\\\nAnd there are dozens of stories from far lesser-known political officials like Hartman. \\\\nShe lost her county clerk race and hasn\\\\\\'t sought elective office since in her town of 7,700. The man who threw the dummy pipe bomb pleaded guilty. Hartman said he was paid to do it by a neighbor, and she remains skittish two years later. \\\\nIn York County, South Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina, County Council Chairwoman Christi Cox said that after the attempt on Trump, she felt compelled to speak about a letter she recently received.

The old-school models like these — once driven as taxis — used to dot city blocks as the quirky look captured the fascination of many around the world. It was long known as \\\\\"the people\\\\\\\\\\'s car.\\\\\"\\\\nBut after production of older models halted in Mexico in 2003, and the newer versions in 2019, the Bug population is dwindling in the metro area of 23 million people. But in the northern neighborhood of Cuautepec, classic Beetles still line the streets — so much so that the area has been nicknamed \\\\\"Vocholandia.\\\\\"\\\\nTaxi drivers like Navarro say they continue to use the vochos because the cars are inexpensive and the engine located in the back of the vehicle gives it more power to climb the neighborhood\\\\\\'s steep hills.\\\\nNavarro began driving Beetles for work eight years ago as a way to feed her three children and put them through school.\\\\n\\\\\"When they ask me what I do for work, I say proudly that I\\\\\\\\\\'m a vochera (a vocho driver),\\\\\" Navarro said a day before the International Day of the VW Beetle on Saturday. \\\\\"This work keeps me afloat … It\\\\\\\\\\'s my adoration, my love.\\\\\"\\\\nWhile some of the older cars wobble along, paint long faded after years of wear and tear, other drivers dress their cars up, keeping them in top shape.\\\\nOne driver has named his bright blue car \\\\\"Gualupita\\\\\" after his wife, Guadalupe, and adorns the bottom with aluminum flames blasting out from a VW logo.

But since Volkswagen halted production five years ago, parts have been harder to come by.\\\\n\\\\\"With the current trend, it will disappear in two or three years,\\\\\" Enojosa said, his hands blackened by car grease. \\\\\"Before we had too many parts for vochos, now there aren\\\\\\\\\\'t enough … So they have to look for parts in repair shops or junkyards.\\\\\"\\\\nAs he spoke, a customer walked up carrying a worn down bolt, looking for a replacement for his Volkswagen\\\\\\\\\\'s clutch.\\\\nThe customer, Jesús Becerra, was in luck: Enojosa strolled out of his shop holding a shiny new bolt.\\\\nLess lucky drivers have to do laps around the neighborhood looking for certain parts. Even more cars fall into disrepair and don\\\\\\\\\\'t pass emissions inspections.\\\\nBut Becerra is among those who believed that the vochos will endure in his neighborhood.\\\\n\\\\\"You adapt them, you find a way to make it keep running,\\\\\" he said. \\\\\"You say, ‘We\\\\\\\\\\'re going to do this, fix it and let\\\\\\\\\\'s go.\\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\"\\\\nOthers like Joaquín Peréz say continuing to drive his 1991 white, Herbie-style Beetle is a way to carry on his family tradition.

He hobbles offstage as a feeble old man, then dashes back on moments later as a fierce warrior.

Social distancing restrictions during the pandemic hit theaters hard, and audiences are still coming back.\\\\nDanjuro has made efforts to update Kabuki in \\\\Hoshiawase Jusandan,\\\\\" at the Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo through July 24, trimming longer scenes and modernizing some dialogue. \\\\n\\\\\"Traditional culture might be hard to follow and get tiresome, but I hope people will have fun.

When he was 20, about to go on stage for the first time as the monk Benkei — a role that his father, grandfather and all the Danjuros before him had made famous — the pressure was so intense he ran away and spent the night sleeping in the park.

At 35, he was still a novice by Kabuki standards, an artform in which beautiful maidens are often played by octogenarian masters. He had to turn to uncles and veterans from other families to learn the craft, defying criticism from peers and even family who said only a Danjuro can teach another Danjuro. \\\\nBut these days, critics say the 13th Danjuro is living up to his name. \\\\nDespite the art\\\\\\'s firm commitment to tradition, Danjuro says, Kabuki stories contain universal emotions that young people and foreigners who are new to the genre can connect with.\\\\nIn \\\\\"Hoshiawase Jusandan,\\\\\" he plays a fox who disguises himself as a warrior to stalk a court dancer who\\\\\\'s carrying a drum made from the hide of his parents.\\\\nWhen at the climax, a merciful samurai gives the fox the drum, Danjuro\\\\\\'s takes flight on wires, bouncing with joy over the crowd toward the third-floor balcony seats, accompanied by drums, flute and song. \\\\nThe showy, somewhat dated effect could look like something out of a circus — but it sells a moving scene that contrasts the human folly of war and revenge with the simple love shown by an animal. \\\\nFor all his worry, Danjuro says he trusts that the power of human performance will survive. \\\\nHe\\\\\\'s training his son Shinnosuke to take his place, and taking care of his health to be sure future generations of Shinnosukes have a chance to know their ancestor.\\\\nOne day, Shinnosuke will become Ebizo, and later, he\\\\\\'ll be Danjuro XIV. \\\\n\\\\\"One must live,\\\\\" said Danjuro. \\\\\"That\\\\\\\\\\'s my responsibility.\\\\\"\\\\n___\\\\nYuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\\\\n\"',\n",

       " {'stuf': {'orinal_article': 'NEW YORK (AP) — Victoria Cornejo Barrera thought the legal helpline for workers sounded too good to be true. \\\\nA month earlier, Cornejo Barrera had been forced to take leave from her job as head custodian at a South Carolina high school after she turned in a doctor\\\\\\'s note asking to be exempt from tasks like climbing ladders and lifting more than 20 pounds because she was pregnant. \\\\nShe spent a month crying and blaming herself for thinking she could keep her job while pregnant. She used up all her accumulated paid time off because she couldn\\\\\\'t afford to go without a paycheck. Then she got a notice from human resources saying she would have to start paying $600 a month to stay on health insurance while on unpaid leave.\\\\n\\\\I was feeling so guilty. I was feeling like my pregnancy was the problem,\\\\\" Cornejo Barrera said. \\\\nSearching for help online, she came across the website run by the legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, explaining about a federal law called the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that entitled her to the types of accommodations she had been seeking. It had gone into effect in June 2023, a month before she was pushed out of her job.\\\\nWas the law really on her side? Cornejo Barrera called the helpline.\\\\nA new law\\\\\\'s complicated first year \\\\nNearly 500 workers in similar circumstances have contacted the helpline in the year since the implementation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which strengthens the rights of workers to seek accommodations for pregnancy-related needs. The experiences of those workers tell a complicated story about the impact of a new law that is still unfamiliar to many employers, according to a report released Tuesday by A Better Balance, the organization that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for the law, which Congress finally passed in December 2022. \\\\nMost of those workers swiftly obtained accommodation after learning about their rights and invoking them with their employers, said Dina Bakst, co-founder and co-president of A Better Balance. But many women confronted employers who didn\\\\\\'t know about the law, misunderstood its scope or simply refused to comply, according to the report.\\\\nA bitter legal battle over whether the law covers abortion is further complicating its enforcement. \\\\nThe dispute centers on Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations that took effect Tuesday detailing how employers should comply with the law, and which included abortion among the pregnancy-related conditions that entitle workers to time off and other accommodations.\\\\nOn Monday, a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily prohibited the EEOC from enforcing the abortion provision of its rules against employers located in Louisiana and Mississippi, or against the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and three other religious groups that filed a consolidated lawsuit against the EEOC, arguing that the abortion provision is an illegal interpretation of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.\\\\nAnother judge in Arkansas last week dismissed a similar lawsuit filed by Republican attorneys general from 17 states, but Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is leading the case, said he is considering legal options to continue pursuing the challenge. \\\\nThat lawsuit had asked the judge to suspend the EEOC rules in their entirety, a prospect that the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center, along with more than 20 labor and women\\\\\\\\\\'s advocacy groups, warned in amicus briefs could thwart the successful implementation of law. The EEOC\\\\\\'s rules, for example, make clear that employers cannot delay requests by asking pregnant workers for onerous paperwork to back claims of common pregnancy-related limitations such as morning sickness or back pain. \\\\nAlthough the pregnant workers law would remain in place even without the EEOC rules, advocates say it\\\\\\'s a badly needed tool for settling disputes and training employers on compliance. According to A Better Balance, one out of seven workers who contacted its helpline since the law took effect said their employers had ordered them to take leave rather than grant them reasonable accommodations. \\\\nCornejo Barrera was among them, but her employer reversed the decision after she sent her human resources department a letter invoking her rights. Within two days, she shared language from the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act with her supervisor, who then told her she could return to work immediately. \\\\nRaquel Robinson, a telecommunication specialist in Ohio, also ultimately prevailed in a similar confrontation with her company. After her daughter was born in October 2022, Robinson was diagnosed with postpartum depression.\\\\n\\\\\"Mentally, I just was not in a good place where I felt like I was good enough to be my daughter\\\\\\\\\\'s mom,\\\\\" she said. \\\\nAfter Robinson\\\\\\'s disability leave ended in July 2023, her therapist told her she was entitled to work from home under the new law. But her company resisted her request for more than a month. \\\\nRobinson reached out to A Better Balance for help and the company relented. \\\\nOther workers are still fighting to be protected under the law. The EEOC says it has received 1,869 charges so far citing violations of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act and has resolved more than 450, though it has not provided details on the cases.\\\\nThe abortion issue complicates the law\\\\nThe law\\\\\\'s passage in 2022 came after years of campaigning by advocacy groups and women in low-wage jobs who shared stories of being denied even basic accommodations. But Republican lawmakers and conservative religious leaders who had overwhelmingly supported the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act were furious when the EEOC rules explicitly included abortion. \\\\nCiting numerous court rulings, the EEOC in its regulations said it was conforming to decades of legal precedent establishing that pregnancy-related discrimination laws include abortion.\\\\nMylissa Farmer, the woman at the center of a federal investigation of two hospitals who refused to provide her with an emergency abortion, said her ordeal shows why the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act must include abortion. \\\\nFarmer sought emergency treatment after her water broke early at 17 weeks of pregnancy in August 2022. Doctors at hospitals in Missouri and Kansas told Farmer her fetus would not survive, that her amniotic fluid had emptied and that she was at risk for serious infection or losing her uterus but they refused to provide an abortion. She and her husband traveled for hours while she was in labor before a clinic in Illinois provided her with an abortion. \\\\nFarmer, who was working a low-wage job as a sales representative, said her supervisor repeatedly contacted her during her ordeal to pressure her to return to work. She said her doctor recommended she take two weeks off to recover but she returned to work after two days because she was afraid of getting fired. But she ended up facing discipline after absences to cope with the physical and mental trauma of losing her pregnancy.\\\\n\\\\\"I was just not able to get the care that I needed at the time and it made it really difficult to even deal with the emotional loss of what we were going through,\\\\\" said Farmer, who is being represented by the National Women\\\\\\'s Law Center in a complaint to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \\\\n___\\\\nThe Associated Press\\\\\\\\\\' women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.
